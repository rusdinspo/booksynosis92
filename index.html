Howard S. Becker looks at the conventions essential to this operation and, prospectively, at the extent to which art is shaped by this collective activity. The book is thoroughly illustrated and updated with a new dialogue between Becker and eminent French sociologist Alain Pessin about the extended social system in which art is created, and with a new preface in which the author talks about his own process in creating this influential work.</p><p><b>Howard S.

William W. Hagen offers the pogroms&#39; first scholarly account, revealing how they served as brutal stagings by ordinary people of scenarios dramatizing popular anti-Jewish fears and resentments. While scholarship on modern anti-Semitism has stressed its ideological inspiration (&#39;print anti-Semitism&#39;), this study shows that anti-Jewish violence by perpetrators among civilians and soldiers expressed magic-infused anxieties and longings for redemption from present threats and suffering (&#39;folk anti-Semitism&#39;). Illustrated with contemporary photographs and constructed from extensive, newly discovered archival sources from three continents, this is an innovative work in east European history. Using extensive first-person testimonies, it reveals gaps - but also correspondences - between popular attitudes and those of the political elite. The pogroms raged against the conscious will of new Poland&#39;s governors whilst Christians high and low sometimes sought, even successfully, to block them.</p><p>This interdisciplinary study of Great War era pogroms will engage scholars of Eastern Europe and ethnic violence, and anyone interested in Polish-Jewish relations. William W. Hagen shows that collective anti-Jewish violence enacted scenarios expressing war-generated anxieties and resentments, understood by perpetrators more in folk-cultural than political-ideological terms.William W. Hagen is Professor Emeritus of History at the University of California, Davis. He has published extensively, including German History in Modern Times (2012), which was selected as an &#39;outstanding academic work&#39; by the American Library Association&#39;s journal, Choice.</p><h2>Handbook for Educational Leadership Interns, A: A Rite of Passage</h2><p><p>Focused on making the internship experience enlightening, developmental, and enjoyable, <i>Educational Administration Field Experiences</i> is a hands-on guide for all individuals completing internships in both public and private schools.&nbsp; The internship experience is one of the most important parts of an educational administrative program, yet it is one for which there is the least student written support. This handbook is generic enough to fit all internship courses and yet it provides the exact kind of support to students allowing them to successfully plan and conduct a highly effective internship experience. The text includes worksheets, competency guides, surveys, forms, self-reflection tools, internship aids, guided reflections and, most importantly, planning techniques to ensure that students get the most from their internship experiences. It successfully integrates students&#x2019; practical experiences, with learning aids, solid research and theory, and suggestions from practitioners related to best practices, making it a crucial tool in preparing for and executing a successful and worthwhile internship.</p></p><p><p>Cunningham provides the profession with the first true textbook/workbook to anchor leadership courses.&nbsp; His compendium and guide is filled with research&#x2013;and wisdom and insights&#x2013;that bring connectivity and coherence to this critical aspect of clinical work. In his transparent style and by speaking directly to interns he surfaces important questions, reveals critical forks in the road, and makes complex ideas accessible.&nbsp; And by accomplishing all this he illuminates the pathway of highly productive field-based work for all of us in educational leadership.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Joe Murphy</p> <p> <i>Professor of Education</i> </p> <p> <i>Vanderbilt</i> <i> University</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This handbook offers valuable and comprehensive guidelines to administrative interns, university supervisors, and administrator mentors to collaboratively establish a high quality intern learning and development experience.&nbsp; Perhaps most importantly, the handbook carefully aligns recommended intern activities and candidate assessment practices with current national administrator preparation standards to prepare strong instructional leaders who can effectively lead improved K&#x2014;12 student learning for all children.&nbsp; In sum, Cunningham&#x2019;s handbook provides a solid foundation on which to build high quality internship experiences for school leader candidates.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Diana G. Pounder</p> <p> <i>Professor and Department Chair, Educational Leadership and Policy&nbsp; </i> </p> <p> <i>University</i> <i> of Utah</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Professor Cunningham&#x2019;s handbook provides aspiring educational leaders with a wealth of guidance and ideas that can help them effectively manage the complexities of preparation programs, especially the clinical experiences associated with these programs. It goes even farther, providing them with solid advice about getting through culminating assessment processes and successfully applying for that illusive first leadership position. Best of all, the book is reality-based, replete with meaningful hands-on activities, and the style and language are user friendly.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Mike Milstein</p> <p> <i>Professor Emeritus, Educational Leadership</i> </p> <p> <i>University</i> <i> of New Mexico</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This book will benefit the field by providing the essential information, processes and tools that universities and districts need to address important internship issues and collaboratively build and provide internships that are the sturdy vessel upon which new practitioners can navigate the swift, unpredictable currents that separate classroom theory and on-the-job reality.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Gene Bottoms</p> <p> <i>Senior Vice President</i> </p> <p> <i>&nbsp;Southern Regional Education Board</i> </p></p><h2>Animal-Assisted Therapy in Counseling</h2><p><p>The third edition of <i>Animal-Assisted Therapy in Counseling</i> is the most comprehensive book available dedicated to training mental health practitioners in the performance of animal assisted therapy in counseling (AAT-C). New to this edition is discussion of the human-animal relational theory, a new theory dedicated to the practice of AAT-C. This edition also has added applications for supervision and includes the most recent research and practice. Consistent with previous editions, a variety of animal-assisted interventions are described with case examples provided in a variety of settings with different types of animals. This unique resource is an indispensable guide for any counselor or psychotherapist looking to develop and implement AAT techniques in practice.</p></p><p><p><strong>Cynthia K.

It is full of updated research and provides the reader with strong practical suggestions for implementation. The book will be a great asset for any mental health practitioner interested in applying animal assisted interventions into their practice."</p><b> </b><p><b>Aubrey H. Fine, EdD, </b>professor, California State Polytechnic University</p> <p></p> <p>"This book is an excellent resource for practitioners who want to include AAT into counseling practice. It is very well written, clear, thorough, and approachable for novice and experienced AAT practitioners alike. Of particular value are Chandler's strategies for including AAT into well-established counseling theoretical orientations. It is the first book I recommend to my own counseling students who are interested in AAT." </p><b> </b><p><b>Leslie A. Stewart, PhD, LPC, </b>assistant professor of counseling, Idaho State University</p> <p></p> <p>"The new edition of <i>Animal Assisted Therapy in Counseling</i> clearly explains the practical skills needed for clinical application of animals in counseling settings and the empirical evidence supporting how animals can improve mental health treatment outcomes. This volume is a carefully organized review of the practice and promise of animal assisted therapy in the treatment of mental health issues with attention to the safety, well-being, and ethical considerations of the human and non-human participants."</p><b> </b><p><b>Philip Tedeschi, </b>clinical professor, executive director, Institute for Human-Animal Connection, Graduate School of Social Work, University of Denver</p> <p>"It is within relationships that counselors and clients process therapeutic material leading to change. In this substantially updated third edition, Dr. Chandler not only provides comprehensive information about all aspects of animal assisted therapy in mental health, but also offers clear insight into how this unique modality actually works. Her contribution of human-animal relational theory is significant because it delves into the <i>process</i> by which the ethical involvement of animals facilitates therapeutic work.

Together, <i>Acting One/Acting Two</i> provides a <i>comprehensive and fully integrated system of all acting</i>, from the most realistic to the most stylized. Part One (<i>Acting One</i>) covers basic skills such as talking, listening, tactical interplay, physicalizing, building scenes, and making powerful acting choices. Part Two (<i>Acting Two</i>) provides a series of exercises that encourage the student actor's self-extension into radically different styles (historical, literary, fantastical) and characterizations; then coaches the student through scenework in a variety of historical periods (Greek, Commedia, Elizabethan, Moli�re, Restoration, Belle Epoque), as well as modern hyper-realistic theatrical forms such as the theatres of alienation and the absurd, and exemplary recent dramas by Tony Kushner, Margaret Edson, August Wilson and Doug Wright.</p><p>ROBERT COHEN was the founding chair Drama at the University of California at Irvine, where he continues to serve as the department&#39;s Claire Trevor Professor of Drama. He has also been a resident acting teacher at the Actors Center in New York, the Shanghai Theatre Academy, the Korean National Arts University, and the national theatre academies of Hungary, Finland, and Estonia. He is an accomplished stage director, scholar, playwright, drama critic, and teacher. A director by training (Doctor of Fine Arts, Yale Drama School), Cohen has staged thirteen professional productions at the Utah and Colorado Shakespeare Festivals, plus well over a hundred productions at Stages Theatre Center (Hollywood), Virginia Museum Theatre (Richmond), Theatre 40 (Beverly Hills), Image Theatre (Boston), Summer Repertory Theatre (Santa Rosa), the Medieval Drama Project (Irvine), the Manhattan Theatre Source, various universities, and several operas, videos and films. In addition to Theatre and Theatre: Brief Edition, he is also the author of many theatre books, including Acting One, Advanced Acting, Acting in Shakespeare, Acting Professionally, Acting Power, More Power to You, Giraudoux: Three Faces of Destiny, Creative Play Direction, and two dramatic anthologies. His essays have appeared in Theatre Journal, Theatre Topics, Theatre Forum, Theatre Survey, Modern Drama, Theater der Zeit, Essays in Theatre, On Stage Studies, The Drama Review, Contemporary Literature, Contemporary Literary Criticism, Slavic and East European Performance, Experiment and Innovation, and Dramatic Theory and Criticism. Cohen&#39;s play, The Prince, published by Dramatic Publishing Company, has been professionally produced in Long Beach, Pittsburgh, Budapest, and in staged readings in New York and Los Angeles; his dramatic translations (The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Misanthrope, Clizia, Tibi&#39;s Law) and opera translations (The Magic Flute, Carmen) have been both produced and published widely. For the past twenty years, Cohen has been the Southern California drama critic for Plays International, reviewing over two hundred plays. In 1999, he received the national Career Achievement award from ATHE - the Association for Theatre in Higher Education.</p><h2>The Partisan Sort: How Liberals Became Democrats and Conservatives Became Republicans (Chicago Studies in American Politics)</h2><p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Washington elites drifted toward ideological poles over the past few decades, did ordinary Americans follow their lead? In <i>The Partisan Sort</i>, Matthew Levendusky reveals that we have responded to this trend&#x2014;but not, for the most part, by becoming more extreme ourselves. While polarization has filtered down to a small minority of voters, it also has had the more significant effect of reconfiguring the way we sort ourselves into political parties.</p> <p>In a marked realignment since the 1970s&#x2014;when partisan affiliation did not depend on ideology and both major parties had strong liberal and conservative factions&#x2014;liberals today overwhelmingly identify with Democrats, as conservatives do with Republicans. This &#x201c;sorting,&#x201d; Levendusky contends, results directly from the increasingly polarized terms in which political leaders define their parties. Exploring its far-reaching implications for the American political landscape, he demonstrates that sorting makes voters more loyally partisan, allowing campaigns to focus more attention on mobilizing committed supporters. Ultimately, Levendusky concludes, this new link between party and ideology represents a sea change in American politics.</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><b>Matthew Levendusky</b> is assistant professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania.&#34;The Partisan Sort is a very impressive contribution to a couple of highly contested contemporary debates in American politics. Matthew Levendusky offers a compelling explanation of why American voters increasingly align themselves with the &#39;correct&#39; political party - liberals with Democrats and conservatives with Republicans - and fruitfully draws out the potential implications of this development.&#34; - Jeff Manza, New York University&#34;</p><h2>Prescriptions for Choral Excellence</h2><p>In shaping choral tone, directors often wish to improve the sound of their choir, but are challenged to pinpoint underlying problems or to guide singers toward solutions. Now, in <em>Prescriptions for Choral Excellence</em>, skilled vocal pedagogue Shirlee Emmons and leading choral director Constance Chase equip choral directors with the practical tools they need to help singers achieve peak choral performance. <br>Drawing on years of experience, Emmons and Chase help choral directors and singers effectively diagnose and resolve problems. They cover topics ranging from breath management and diction to range and intonation, and much more. Beyond describing vocal difficulties, the book provides concrete instructions on how to apply the concepts in day-to-day rehearsal and performance. The numerous practical exercises and planning aides allow directors to maximize both time and talent to elicit the highest potential from their singers. While grounded in the most up-to-date research in voice science, the discussion of vocal anatomy and function is accessible to readers with no previous knowledge of voice science. Going beyond other vocal and choral guidebooks, the authors also apply the most current theories in leadership principles and group dynamics to choral settings, helping directors translate their natural musicality and charisma into inspiring and motivational leadership. <br>A comprehensive and unique blend of practical expertise, voice science, and leadership psychology, <em>Prescriptions for Choral Excellence</em> is an invaluable guide for all choral directors seeking to create memorable and remarkable performances.</p><p><br><strong>Shirlee Emmons</strong> is a voice teacher of considerable renown. She has taught at Columbia, Princeton, Boston, and Rutgers Universities, as well as at universities in Korea and Austria.

As Director of the Cadet Glee Club, United States Military Academy at West Point, she conducts scores of concerts, live national television appearances, and recordings for film and commercial release.<br><br>"As a conductor with more than thirty years' experience, I found this book to be rigorous, comprehensive, and dynamically user-friendly. The book presents an abundance of practical tools. The less experienced conductors will find this book indispensable and immediately accessible. This is a must read for choral directors at any level as well as for singers and teachers of singing.--<em>American Music Teacher</em><p></p><br>"This book provides a wealth of vocal information for choral conductors, ranging from matters of basic technique to physical health and the effects of various medical conditions on singing. Facilitating good singing in the choral ensemble benefits everyone and serves to break down barriers, true or false, between the singer as a 'soloist' and the singer as a choral musician. This should be an essential addition to every choral conductor's reference library."--Hilary Apfelstadt, Professor of Music and Director of Choral Activities, The Ohio State University<p></p><br>"Adopting a unique format, Emmons and Chase have authored a text for every Choral Director and student of choral singing. Providing clear and concise answers to the fundamental questions of vocal technique and choral leadership, this is a text that will be read and re-read again and again. It should be a staple in every choral musician's library."--Donald Simonson, Professor of Music Voice Division Chair, Iowa State University<p></p><br>"The doctor is in! <em>Prescriptions for Choral Excellence</em> is the medicine that choral directors and singers need for success. Applying the latest principles and techniques of leadership psychology, this detailed guide is an invaluable resource for meeting many of the demands that all directors face."--Marshall Goldsmith, executive coach and author of <em>The Leader of the Future</em>, <em>Coaching for Leadership</em> and <em>Global Leadership: The Next Generation</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Diary of Antera Duke, an Eighteenth-Century African Slave Trader</h2><p>In his diary, Antera Duke (ca.1735-ca.1809) wrote the only surviving eyewitness account of the slave trade by an African merchant. A leader in late eighteenth-century Old Calabar, a cluster of Efik-speaking communities in the Cross River region, he resided in Duke Town, forty-five miles from the Atlantic Ocean in what is now southeast Nigeria. His diary, written in trade English from 1785 to 1788, is a candid account of daily life in an African community at the height of Calabar's overseas commerce. It provides valuable information on Old Calabar's economic activity both with other African businessmen and with European ship captains who arrived to trade for slaves, produce, and provisions. <br> This new edition of Antera's diary, the first in fifty years, draws on the latest scholarship to place the diary in its historical context. Introductory essays set the stage for the Old Calabar of Antera Duke's lifetime, explore the range of trades, from slaves to produce, in which he rose to prominence, and follow Antera on trading missions across an extensive commercial hinterland. The essays trace the settlement and development of the towns that comprised Old Calabar and survey the community's social and political structure, rivalries among families, sacrifices of slaves, and witchcraft ordeals. This edition reproduces Antera's original trade-English diary with a translation into standard English on facing pages, along with extensive annotation. <em>The Diary of Antera Duke</em> furnishes a uniquely valuable source for the history of precolonial Nigeria and the Atlantic slave trade, and this new edition enriches our understanding of it.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen D.

For many years, Stiegler has explored the origins and philosophical, ethical, and political stakes of a global process he calls "the industrial temporalization of consciousness." Here, demonstrating that technology&#x2015;including alphabetical writing&#x2015;is memory, he argues that through new technologies of retention and inscription we have come to live in a world where time devours space, a disoriented world in which we have lost our bearings. Immersed in the multimedia of an over-connected world, with time and space as we know them abolished, we no longer find "cardinal points" to guide us and may even be led where we do not wish to go. We must therefore prepare to confront new spheres of ideological control and discover new possibilities in the digital environment. </p></p><p>Bernard Stiegler is Head of the Department of Cultural Development at the Pompidou Center in Paris and co-founder of the political group <i>Ars Industrialis</i>. In the last five years alone, he has authored seventeen books."Bernard Stiegler's ambition for <i>Technics and Time 2: Disorientation</i> is exhilaratingly immodest: he promises to offer nothing less than a history of temporality, from prehistoric man to the present day . . . Stiegler makes a convincing case for the vital importance of the politics of memory in the 21st century." (Julian Brigstocke <i><i>Environment and Planning D: Society and Space</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>Disorientation</i>, a most important piece of scholarly work, continues and adds to the development of the arguments set forth in the preceding volume of <i>Technics and Time</i>, putting a whole new set of clarifications into place.

(What is Sociology?)</h2><p>With an entire discipline devoted to political science, what is distinctive about political sociology? This concise book explains what a sociological perspective brings to our understanding of the emergence, reproduction, and transformation of different forms of political order. Crucially, political sociology expands the field of view to the politics that happen in other social settings &#x2013; in the family, at work, in civic associations &#x2013; as well as the ways in which social attributes such as class, religion, age, race, and gender shape patterns of political participation and the distribution of political power. <br><br>Political sociology grapples with these issues across an enormous range of historical and geographic settings, from the intimate relations that constitute family politics to the geo-political scales of war and trade. It requires an analytic toolkit that includes concepts of power, social closure, civil society, and modes of political action. Using these central concepts, <i>What is Political Sociology? </i>discusses the major forms of political order (states, empires, and nation-states), processes of regime formation and revolution, the social bases for political participation, policy formation as well as feedbacks, and the possibilities for new forms of transnational politics. In sum, the book offers an insightful introduction to this core perspective on social life.</p><p>Elisabeth S. Clemens is William Rainey Harper Professor of Sociology at the University of Chicago"With this masterful and definitive work, Clemens not only illuminates the key concepts and theories in political sociology, she also presents original and compelling arguments about the social bases of political orders.

For each park and topic the story unfolds in three steps: what does the reader see for him - or herself? What is the scientific cause or explanation of what is seen? And finally, what is the big picture about ourselves, our world, and our Universe? The author takes us the length and breadth of the U.S., from the coast of Maine to the Yellowstone volcano, from the depths of the Grand Canyon to the heights of the Rocky Mountains, exploring the natural links between the features of the parks and those of our Universe.Dr. Nordgren is an Associate Professor of Physics at the University of Redlands. As an observational astronomer he has written over two dozen peer-reviewed papers on pulsars, the interstellar medium, star formation in galaxies, the distribution of dark matter in galaxies, and the atmospheres and pulsation of red giant stars. In addition, he has professional interests in archaeoastronomy, light pollution and science education. These interests were developed during positions held as an astronomer at the U.S. Naval Observatory and then Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff Arizona. Both institutions have worked diligently and successfully with local governments to establish light pollution ordinances. Dr. Nordgren has designed and built sundials, including a two-story dial at the University of Redlands, and is one of seven scientists and artists that turned the NASA Mars Exploration Rover camera calibration targets into working Martian sundials. These Marsdials have become the most photographed objects of the Spirit and Opportunity Rover mission. In addition, while at the U.S. Naval Observatory and later University of Redlands, he worked with NPS park managers at Wupatki National Monument and Chaco Culture National Historic Park to photograph alignments of ancestral Puebloan kivas with respect to the North Star. In 2005 Dr. Nordgren began working with Chad Moore, leader of the National Park Service Night Sky Team who has developed a method of quantifying the amount of light pollution in the skies above the national parks. With his support, Dr. Nordgren is working with the U.S. National Park Service to spend his sabbatical during the 2007-2008 academic school year in the national parks writing the remainder of the book.</p><h2>Six Ideas that Shaped Physics: Unit N - Laws of Physics are Universal (WCB Physics)</h2><p><p>Six Ideas That Shaped Physics is the 21st Century's alternative to traditional, encyclopedic textbooks.

Built with the idea of attracting short-distance passenger traffic and light freight, the interurbans were largely constructed in the early 1900s. The rise of the automobile and motor transport caused the industry to decline after World War I, and the depression virtually annihilated the industry by the middle 1930s. Part I describes interurban construction, technology, passenger and freight traffic, financial history, and final decline and abandonment. Part II presents individual histories (with route maps) of the more than 300 companies of the interurban industry. <i>Reviews</i> "A first-rate work of such detail and discernment that it might well serve as a model for all corporate biographies. . . .

These lectures focus on developing the concepts critical to the introductory section of that book. They show Adorno as an embattled philosopher defining his own methodology among the prevailing trends of the time. As a critical theorist, he repudiated the worn-out Marxist stereotypes still dominant in the Soviet bloc &#x2013; he specifically addresses his remarks to students who had escaped from the East in the period leading up to the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961. Influenced as he was by the empirical schools of thought he had encountered in the United States, he nevertheless continued to resist what he saw as their surrender to scientific and mathematical abstraction. However, their influence was potent enough to prevent him from reverting to the traditional idealisms still prevalent in Germany, or to their latest manifestations in the shape of the new ontology of Heidegger and his disciples. Instead, he attempts to define, perhaps more simply and fully than in the final published version, a &#x2018;negative', i.e. critical, approach to philosophy. Permeating the whole book is Adorno&#x2019;s sense of the overwhelming power of totalizing, dominating systems in the post-Auschwitz world. Intellectual negativity, therefore, commits him to the stubborn defence of individuals &#x2013; both facts and people &#x2013; who stubbornly refuse to become integrated into &#x2018;the administered world&#x2019;. <p>These lectures reveal Adorno to be a lively and engaging lecturer. He makes serious demands on his listeners but always manages to enliven his arguments with observations on philosophers and writers such as Proust and Brecht and comments on current events. Heavy intellectual artillery is combined with a concern for his students&#x2019; progress.</p></p><p><b>Theodor Adorno </b>was a member of the Frankfurt School."The best introduction to Adorno's thought is Adorno's lectures: patient and expansive, they provide the darkest corners of his thought with light and air. Aiming to elaborate the basic assumptions and working method behind his philosophical practice in general, these lapidary lectures touch on many of the most difficult aspects of Adorno's philosophy."<br> <b>J.

By highlighting the connections among different aspects of development, the text helps students to better understand the concepts covered. With the help of several experts in the field, John Santrock discusses current research and real-world applications, helping students see how developmental psychology plays a role in their own lives and future careers. Additionally, through an integrated, personalized digital learning program, students gain the insight they need to study smarter and improve performance.<br>The Milestones video program shows students what developmental concepts look like by letting them watch actual humans develop.

These volumes by a pioneering neurocomputing group suggest that the answer lies in the massively parallel architecture of the human mind. They describe a new theory of cognition called connectionism that is challenging the idea of symbolic computation that has traditionally been at the center of debate in theoretical discussions about the mind. </p><p>The authors' theory assumes the mind is composed of a great number of elementary units connected in a neural network. Mental processes are interactions between these units which excite and inhibit each other in parallel rather than sequential operations. In this context, knowledge can no longer be thought of as stored in localized structures; instead, it consists of the connections between pairs of units that are distributed throughout the network. </p><p>Volume 1 lays the foundations of this exciting theory of parallel distributed processing, while Volume 2 applies it to a number of specific issues in cognitive science and neuroscience, with chapters describing models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought.</p></p><p>This two-volume work is now considered a classic in the field. It presents the results of the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) group&#39;s work in the early 1980s and provides a good overview of the earlier neural network research. The PDP approach (also known as connectionism among other things) is based on the conviction that various aspects of cognitive activity are thought of in terms of massively parallel processing. The first volume starts with the general framework and continues with an analysis of learning mechanisms and various mathematical and computational tools important in the analysis of neural networks. The chapter on backpropagation is written by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, who codiscovered the algorithm in 1986. The second volume is written with a psychological and biological emphasis. It explores the relationship of PDP to various aspects of human cognition. The book is a comprehensive research survey of its time and most of the book&#39;s results and methods are still at the foundation of the neural network field.This book describes the authors work in developing a theoretical framework for describing parallel distributed processing activity and in applying the framework to the development of models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought.</p><h2>The Law of American Health Care (Aspen Casebook)</h2><p><p><em>The Law of American Health Care</em> is the casebook for the new generation of health lawyers.

Ehrenfeld, and his former student now professor, Andrew J. Hoffman, as they discuss how to create a sustainable world. Unlike virtually all other books about sustainability, this one goes beyond the typical stories that we tell ourselves about repairing the environmental damages of human progress. Through their dialogue and essays that open each section, the authors uncover two core facets of our culture that drive the unsustainable, unsatisfying, and unfair social and economic machines that dominate our lives. First, our collective model of the way the world works cannot cope with the inherent complexity of today's highly connected, high-speed reality. Second, our understanding of human behavior is rooted in this outdated model. Driven by the old guard, sustainability has become little more than a fashionable idea. As a result, both business and government are following the wrong path&#x2015;at best applying temporary, less unsustainable solutions that will fail to leave future generations in better shape. To shift the pendulum, this book tells a new story, driven by being and caring, as opposed to having and needing, rooted in the beauty of complexity and arguing for the transformative cultural shift that we can make based on our collective wisdom and lived experiences. Then, the authors sketch out the road to a flourishing future, a change in our consumption and a new approach to understanding and acting. There is no middle ground; without a sea change at the most basic level, we will continue to head down a faulty path. Indeed, this book is a clarion call to action. Candid and insightful, it leaves readers with cautious hope.</p><p>John R. Ehrenfeld is a long-standing and influential voice in the sustainability debate. He was Director of the MIT Program on Technology, Business, and Environment. From 2000-2009, he served as Executive Director of the International Society for Industrial Ecology. He continues to do research, write, and teach, most recently at several emerging MBA for Sustainability programs. He is the author of <i>Sustainability by Design: A Subversive Strategy for Transforming our Consumer Culture</i>. Andrew J. Hoffman is the Holcim (US) Professor of Sustainable Enterprise at the University of Michigan. He serves as Director of the Frederick A. and Barbara M. Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise. Hoffman is co-editor of <i>The Oxford Handbook on Business and the Natural Environment</i>, author of <i>Builder's Apprentice: A Memoir</i>, and co-author of <i>Memo to the CEO: Climate Change, What's Your Business Strategy?</i>"This is a deeply illuminating conversation between two sustainability thought leaders on whom I wish I had been able to eavesdrop. Now, happily and inspirationally, we all can." (John Elkington)<br><br>"John Ehrenfeld's thinking about our species and our place in the world is indeed a thing of beauty, as Andrew Hoffman's intelligent dialogue with him brings out on every page. If you're tired of stale books on 'sustainability,' read this for new insight and inspiration." (James Gustave Speth <i>author of <i>America the Possible: Manifesto for a New Economy</i></i>)<br><br>"The most a dangerous time for any radical idea is when it becomes popular and people assume that because they embrace the idea they are 'doing it.' The window is closing for consciously altering the trajectory of global industrial expansion. There are no simple answers, but there are core questions and critical actions to take. In <i>Flourishing</i>, these are clearly illuminated by John Ehrenfeld and Andy Hoffman, two of the most experienced and thoughtful leaders in the sustainability movement." (Peter M. Senge <i>MIT, Society for Organizational Learning, Author of <i>The Fifth Discipline</i>, and Co-Author of <i>Presence, and The Necessary Revolution</i></i>)<br><br>"A fresh, daring look at sustainable business. It takes no prisoners and does not try to please&#x2015;it simply tells the brutal truth." (Joel Makower, Chairman and Executive Editor <i>GreenBiz Group Inc.</i>)<br><br>"For those who are familiar with Ehrenfeld and Hoffman's arguments, the conversational approach in this book develops nuances that take key messages about sustainability and flourishing to a new level. Those not yet familiar are also in for a treat with this easy-to-read, yet critically important manifesto." (Jennifer Howard-Grenville <i>University of Oregon and author of <i>Corporate Culture and Environmental Practice: Making Change at a High-Technology Manufacturer</i></i>)<br><br>"These are unexpectedly deep and moving conversations about where we can go, and where we must go, both as individuals and as a planet. It's a hardheaded account of the sacredness of the earth, and what that implies for our work and society." (Bill McKibben)</p><h2>In the World Interior of Capital: Towards a Philosophical Theory of Globalization</h2><p>Displaying the distinctive combination of narration and philosophy for which he is well known, this new book by Peter Sloterdijk develops a radically new account of globalization at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The author takes seriously the historical and philosophical consequences of the notion of the earth as a globe, arriving at the thesis that what is praised or decried as globalization is actually the end phase in a process that began with the first circumnavigation of the earth � and that one can already discern elements of a new era beyond globalization.&nbsp;<br> <br> In the end phase of globalization, the world system completed its development and, as a capitalist system, came to determine all conditions of life. Sloterdijk takes the Crystal Palace in London, the site of the first world exhibition in 1851, as the most expressive metaphor for this situation. The palace demonstrates the inevitable exclusivity of globalization as the construction of a comfort structure � that is, the establishment and expansion of a world interior whose boundaries are invisible, yet virtually insurmountable from without, and which is inhabited by one and a half billion winners of globalization; three times this number are left standing outside the door.</p><p><p><b>Peter Sloterdijk</b> is Professor of Philosophy and Aesthetics at the Karlsruhe School of Design.</p>"Confirms Sloterdijk as the thinking European's Slavoj ?i?ek, as restlessly digressive as his Slovenian counterpart, but even more intellectually reckless and better company."<br> <i><b>The Guardian</b></i><br> <br> "In the last few years Sloterdijk has moved from a figure of relative obscurity in Anglophone debates to being one of the key thinkers of our time. This wide-ranging, engaging, thoughtful and provocative book illustrates why. An unashamedly grand narrative, it engages with both the philosophical and political complexities of the question of the world. It is once again presented in a very fine translation by Wieland Hoban."<br> <b>Stuart Elden, Durham University</b><br> <br> "Peter Sloterdijk never disappoints when it comes to producing an original point of view. Equally, he never disappoints in the magnitude of his ambitions. In this deeply original and hyper-ambitious book, he presents a history of globalization, no less. In doing so, he resurrects what has become a tired and hackneyed term by reconstituting it as a drama of location but one wherein the notion of location is itself brought into the play as a central element of the plot. And what a play it is, the play of an ever-increasing density of events and an ever-decreasing concentration of purpose which &#x2013; if we&#x2019;re not very careful &#x2013; will produce a 'last orb'. Wonderful stuff which restores our faith in the power of grand narratives."<br> <b>Nigel Thrift, University of Warwick</b></p><h2>Of God Who Comes to Mind (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)</h2><p>The thirteen essays collected in this volume investigate the possibility that the word "God" can be understood now, at the end of the twentieth century, in a meaningful way. Nine of the essays appear in English translation for the first time.<br>Among Levinas's writings, this volume distinguishes itself, both for students of his thought and for a wider audience, by the range of issues it addresses. Levinas not only rehearses the ethical themes that have led him to be regarded as one of the most original thinkers working out of the phenomenological tradition, but he also takes up philosophical questions concerning politics, language, and religion. The volume situates his thought in a broader intellectual context than have his previous works. In these essays, alongside the detailed investigations of Husserl, Heidegger, Rosenzweig, and Buber that characterize all his writings, Levinas also addresses the thought of Kierkegaard, Marx, Bloch, and Derrida.<br>Some essays provide lucid expositions not available elsewhere to key areas of Levinas's thought. "God and Philosophy" is perhaps the single most important text for understanding Levinas and is in many respects the best introduction to his works. "From Consciousness to Wakefulness" illuminates Levinas's relation to Husserl and thus to phenomenology, which is always his starting point, even if he never abides by the limits it imposes. In "The Thinking of Being and the Question of the Other," Levinas not only addresses Derrida's <i>Speech and Phenomenon</i> but also develops an answer to the later Heidegger's account of the history of Being by suggesting another way of reading that history.<br>Among the other topics examined in the essays are the Marxist concept of ideology, death, hermeneutics, the concept of evil, the philosophy of dialogue, the relation of language to the Other, and the acts of communication and mutual understanding.</p><p>&#x201c;This relatively small volume of essays offers an ideal introduction to the gist of his profound and stimulating thought and illustrates how Levinas deals with life and death issues.&#x201d;&#x2014;The European LegacyEmmanuel Levinas (1906-1995) est l'un des philosophes francais les plus importants du XXe siecle. <br> <br>Bettina Bergo is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the Universite de Montreal.</p><h2>Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (Big Nerd Ranch Guides)</h2><p><i>Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</i> is an introductory Android book for programmers with Java experience.&nbsp; <br> Based on Big Nerd Ranch&#x2019;s popular Android bootcamps, this guide will lead you through the wilderness using hands-on example apps combined with clear explanations of key concepts and APIs.

Thietmar&#x2019;s testimony also has special value because of his geographical location, in eastern Saxony, on the boundary between German and Slavic cultures. He is arguably the single most important witness to the early history of Poland, and his detailed descriptions of Slavic folklore are the earliest on record.

Silviculturists are under increasing pressure to develop practices that sustain the full function and dynamics of forested ecosystems and maintain ecosystem diversity and resilience while still providing needed wood products. A Critique of Silviculture offers a penetrating look at the current state of the field and provides suggestions for its future development.<br><br> The book includes an overview of the historical developments of silvicultural techniques and describes how these developments are best understood in their contemporary philosophical, social, and ecological contexts. It also explains how the traditional strengths of silviculture are becoming limitations as society demands a varied set of benefits from forests and as we learn more about the importance of diversity on ecosystem functions and processes.<br><br> The authors go on to explain how other fields, specifically ecology and complexity science, have developed in attempts to understand the diversity of nature and the variability and heterogeneity of ecosystems. The authors suggest that ideas and approaches from these fields could offer a road map to a new philosophical and practical approach that endorses managing forests as complex adaptive systems.<br><br> A Critique of Silviculture bridges a gap between silviculture and ecology that has long hindered the adoption of new ideas.

With <i>The Third Reich Sourcebook</i>, editors Anson Rabinbach and Sander L. Gilman present a comprehensive collection of newly translated documents drawn from wide-ranging primary sources, documenting both the official and unofficial cultures of National Socialist Germany from its inception to its defeat and collapse in 1945. Framed with introductions and annotations by the editors, the documents presented here include official government and party pronouncements, texts produced within Nazi structures, such as the official Jewish Cultural League, as well as documents detailing the impact of the horrors of National Socialism on those who fell prey to the regime, especially Jews and the handicapped. With thirty chapters on ideology, politics, law, society, cultural policy, the fine arts, high and popular culture, science and medicine, sexuality, education, and other topics, <i>The Third Reich Sourcebook</i> is the ultimate collection of primary sources on Nazi Germany.</p><p>&#x201c;An absolutely magnificent achievement. After the mountain of books that have been published on Nazism, it can seem implausible that there is still more to learn. This brilliantly conceived collection of primary documents shows that there is indeed more &#x2013; much more. No prior anthology or analysis does nearly so much to help readers enter the emotional landscape of the Third Reich, so as to understand better the at once savage and subtle ideological work that made the regime so terrifyingly successful.&#x201d; &#x2015;Dagmar Herzog, Graduate Center, City University of New York<br><br>&#x201c;The indispensable collection of texts from the Third Reich in this extraordinary volume gives readers first-hand knowledge of the transformation of life in Nazi Germany into a racist state and culture.

While such events have captured the public imagination, they have also generated a new surge of scholarly interest in the field of nonviolence and civil resistance studies. Although researchers have produced new empirical data, theories, and insights into the phenomenon of nonviolent struggle, the field is still quite unfamiliar to many students and scholars. <br><br>In <em>Nonviolent Struggle: Theories, Strategies, and Dynamics</em>, sociologist Sharon Nepstad provides a succinct introduction to the field of civil resistance studies, detailing its genesis, key concepts and debates, and a summary of empirical findings. Nepstad depicts the strategies and dynamics at play in nonviolent struggles, and analyzes the factors that shape the trajectory and outcome of civil resistance movements. The book draws on a vast array of historical examples, including the U.S. civil rights movement, the Indonesian uprising against President Suharto, the French Huguenot resistance during World War II, and Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers. Nepstad describes both principled and pragmatic nonviolent traditions and explains various categories of nonviolent action, concluding with an assessment of areas for future research. <br><br>A comprehensive treatment of the philosophy and strategy of nonviolent resistance, <em>Nonviolent Struggle</em> is essential reading for students, scholars, and anyone with a general interest in peace studies and social change.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sharon Erickson Nepstad</strong> is Professor of Sociology at the University of New Mexico. She is the author of numerous articles and three books, including: <em>Nonviolent Revolutions: Civil Resistance in the Late 20th Century </em>(2011, Oxford University Press); <em>Religion and War Resistance in the Plowshares</em> <em>Movement</em> (2008, Cambridge University Press); and <em>Convictions of the Soul: Religion, Culture, and Agency in the Central American Solidarity Movement</em> (2004, Oxford University Press).<br><br>"It is not an easy task to capture a moving target, but Nepstad has successfully done so, having effectively woven the different threads of this emerging field together. Nonviolent Struggle provides a comprehensive overview of this still under-researched phenomenon and in that sense is clearly one of the foundational academic works... <em>Nonviolent Struggle</em> is a must-read for scholars, students, practitioners and anyone with a general interest in conflict transformation, peace studies, social change and social movements." -- <em>Siddharth Tripathi, Democratization</em><p></p><br>"After languishing for years as a small and somewhat ghettoized area of research, the study of non-violent contention has blossomed in the last decade into one of the liveliest subfields within the broader study of contentious politics. And yet, to date, there has been no single text that surveys and summarizes the mushrooming work in this important area. There is now. Even better, that volume has been authored by, Sharon Nepstad, one of the key figures contributing to the scholarly renaissance in the field. Must reading for anyone who hopes to understand the dynamics of this especially significant form of contentious politics." <br>--Doug McAdam, Stanford University and co-author of <em>Deeply Divided: Racial Politics and Social Movements in Post-War America</em><p></p><br>"In her latest book, Sharon Erickson Nepstad provides a sweeping and thoughtful survey of nonviolent resistance-from philosophical roots to historical and contemporary applications, and from theoretical foundations to unanswered empirical questions that remain. This book will certainly be an invaluable resource for students and researchers of nonviolent struggle for years to come." <br>--Erica Chenoweth, University of Denver<p></p><br>"This is a long-overdue and badly-needed book for this rapidly expanding subfield. For nearly twenty years I've taught an upper-division undergraduate seminar on nonviolence and this is just the kind of text I've been looking for but have yet been able to find." <br>--Stephen Zunes, University of San Francisco<p></p><br>"Sociologist Nepstad (New Mexico) intended her book as a primer on the variety of forms and strategic choices facing those who are interested in resistance to authority as part of achieving social justice. This makes it highly useful as a textbook for courses in human rights, peace studies, or social movements. But it it also a strong introduction to the theories about, history of, and research on, nonviolence for researchers whose work has bordered on but not included this." <br>--M.M.

Follow their paths to incredible wealth, observe their investment missteps as if you are in the room while they are being made and learn how to become a better investor by avoiding these common errors in judgment. <p></p> <i>&#x201c;Better be wise by the misfortune of others than by your own&#x201d; &#x2013; Aesop</i> <p></p> <b>Bill Ackman<br> Discipline means discipline</b>- Bill Ackman and his firm, Pershing Square, had a very profitable experience with Barnes &amp; Noble. Ackman believed he could replicate that success with Borders Group, a competing chain of bookstores, but in order to make that investment he had to violate his discipline. The result was far from what he had hoped. <p></p> <b>David Bonderman<br> <i>Always</i> do your due diligence</b>- David Bonderman, a very careful, accomplished investor, had a long personal and professional history with the CEO of Washington Mutual, and saw opportunity in the popular banking institution. With only a week or so in which to perform due diligence, Bonderman and his firm invested $2 billion in the troubled company. Only five months later, the FDIC seized the bank's assets, making it the biggest bank failure ever. <p></p> <b>Leon Cooperman<br> The absence of regulatory safeguards is a sign of danger ahead</b>- Leon Cooperman was the top investment strategist on Wall Street and a senior partner at Goldman Sachs before forming Omega Advisors, a hedge fund. Presented with the opportunity to invest in the privatization of Azerbaijan's state oil company, Cooperman took the chance but would soon regret it, a victim of fraud by a well-paid employee and an unregulated emerging market. <p></p> <b>Chris Davis<br> Don't own what you don't know</b>- In 2005, Chris Davis significantly increased the Davis Financial Fund's investment in AIG, a company the $60 billion Davis portfolio had owned for more than thirty years. Between the initial investment and the time he added to the position, the AIG in which Chris Davis chose to go "all in" had become a fundamentally different entity - much more complex and murky than a traditional insurance company. When AIG stock plummeted, the loss took a significant toll on the fund's total value. <p></p> <b>Geoff Grant<br> Don't be blinded by outsized returns</b>- Geoff Grant's Peloton Partners found extraordinary success - rising 87 percent in 2007 - with the trading of asset-backed securities (ABS). But with the onset of the global credit crunch, other ABS investors ran for the exits while Peloton stayed put - ultimately wiping out the firm and $2 billion. Weiss counsels caution in chasing hyper-returns, particularly when your style has to drift to get there. <p></p> <b>Kirk Kerkorian<br> Passion is not an investment strategy</b>- Kirk Kerkorian's passion for the American auto industry drove four attempts, three realized, to buy into the Big Three automakers. That passion, combined with early investment successes in the industry, ultimately led to a loss of nearly $800 million when Kerkorian took a large position in Ford. In the world of investing, emotion is the antithesis of discipline. Passion cannot override objectivity. <p></p> <b>Bernie Madoff's investors<br> Be skeptical</b>- Investors who lost billions to Bernie Madoff seemed to have found a deal that was too good to be true - consistent returns at a discount (no fees!). But if something appears too good to be true, it probably is. Investing demands a healthy dose of skepticism. Weiss details the lessons to be learned and followed when temptation presents itself. <p></p> <b>Nick Maounis<br> Understand risk</b>- Nick Maounis and his Amaranth hedge fund found phenomenal success in energy trading before losing more than $6 billion in less time than it takes a half-moon to complete its cycle. Although Amaranth had a highly developed risk management function designed to avert such disasters, the reality is that risk management offers no guarantees. If risk can be the downfall of brilliant and experienced traders, where does that leave the individual investor? Weiss provides the answer to this important question and the lessons for navigating individual risk. <p></p> <b>Aubrey McClendon<br> Leverage is a double-edged sword</b>- Aubrey McClendon leveraged himself to the hilt to buy millions of shares of his own company, Chesapeake Energy. It was a strategy that created a $4 billion fortune. But when gas prices slid, margin calls wiped out nearly all his holdings in the company he had started with just $50,000. Buying on margin - that is, with borrowed money - allows investors to increase the size of their investments, but the penalty for being wrong can be severe. <p></p> <b>Adolf Merckle<br> Short selling: Proceed with caution</b>- Adolf Merckle was one of the wealthiest people in Germany when he risked a fortune "shorting" Volkswagen stock. His multi-hundred-million-dollar bet that the stock price would decline proved a risk he couldn't afford to take, particularly with the rest of his business empire crumbling. With more than a little help from Porsche, VW stock skyrocketed and Merckle - after being forced to sell off assets and beg for loans - hurled himself in front of an oncoming train. Short selling requires a very cautious approach including the observance of specific rules that Weiss details in this chapter. <p></p> <b>Richard Pzena<br> Declining stock prices may not equal opportunity</b>- Richard Pzena saw the collapse in residential mortgages and the tanking of financial stocks in late 2007 and early 2008 as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to pay bargain basement prices for Citigroup, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. Less than a year later, and with financial stocks comprising 40 percent of Pzena's portfolio, Fannie and Freddie were nationalized - essentially wiping out their equity value. Stocks are rarely inefficiently priced, Weiss warns, offering insights on finding opportunity in potential calamity - and avoiding the reverse. <p></p><p><b>THE BILLION DOLLAR MISTAKE</b> offers an up-close account of the career-defining mistakes that some of the world's most brilliant billionaire investors have made&#x2014;and a revealing look at what you can learn from them. These mistakes, while spectacularly large in amount, are commonly simple in practice, identical to the errors in investment judgment made by everyday investors. Drawing on author Stephen Weiss's more than twenty years of experience at some of Wall Street's most prestigious firms, this book is based upon original research and interviews with legendary investors who discuss the most significant trade or investment that went against them, the magnitude of the loss, and its effect on their businesses&#x2014;and their personal lives. </p><p>Page by page, this intriguing book skillfully examines the causal relationship between the quirks of each investor's personality and the mistakes each committed.

Simmons</strong> has academic degrees from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California; the University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; and Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. He taught at several colleges and universities before joining the faculty of Colorado College, Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1962, where he is currently a professor of mathematics. In addition to <i>Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes, Third Edition</i> (CRC Press, 2016), Professor Simmons is the author of <i>Introduction to Topology and Modern Analysis </i>(McGraw-Hill, 1963), <i>Precalculus Mathematics in a Nutshell</i> (Janson Publications, 1981), and <i>Calculus with Analytic Geometry</i> (McGraw-Hill, 1985).</p><p>This is an attractive introductory work on differential equations, with extensive information in addition to what can be covered in a two-semester course. The order of the topics examined is slightly unusual in that Laplacians are covered after Fourier transforms and power series. The chapter on power series contains a section on hypergeometric equations, which could well be the first time that an introductory book on the subject goes that far. The book has plenty of exercises at the end of each section, and also at the end of each chapter. The solutions to some of these are included at the end of the book. Most chapters contain a few appendixes that are several pages long.

For both thinkers, the word <i>adieu</i> names a fundamental characteristic of human being: the salutation or benediction prior to all constative language (in certain circumstances, one can say <i>adieu</i> at the moment of meeting) and that given at the moment of separation, sometimes forever, as at the moment of death, it is also the <i>a-dieu</i>, for God or to God before and in any relation to the other. In this book, Derrida extends his work on Levinas in previously unexplored directions via a radical rereading of <i>Totality and Infinity</i> and other texts, including the lesser-known talmudic readings. He argues that Levinas, especially in <i>Totality and Infinity,</i> bequeaths to us an "immense treatise of hospitality," a meditation on the welcome offered to the other. The conjunction of an ethics of pure prescription with the idea of an infinite and absolute hospitality confronts us with the most pressing political, juridical, and institutional concerns of our time. What, then, is an ethics and what is a politics of hospitality? And what, if it ever <i>is,</i> would be a hospitality surpassing any ethics and any politics we know? As always, Derrida raises these questions in the most explicit of terms, moving back and forth between philosophical argument and the political discussion of immigration laws, peace, the state of Israel, xenophobia&#x2015;reminding us with every move that thinking is not a matter of neutralizing abstraction, but a gesture of hospitality for what happens and still may happen.</p><p>Jacques Derrida was Director of Studies at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris, and Professor of Humanities at the University of California, Irvine. Stanford has published six of his books, most recently <i>Monolingualism of the Other: or, The Prosthesis of Origin</i> (1998).Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Resilience Practice: Building Capacity to Absorb Disturbance and Maintain Function</h2><p>In 2006, <i>Resilience Thinking</i> addressed an essential question: As the natural systems that sustain us are subjected to shock after shock, how much can they take and still deliver the services we need from them? This idea caught the attention of both the scientific community and the general public.<br><br> In <i>Resilience Practice</i>, authors Brian Walker and David Salt take the notion of resilience one step further, applying resilience thinking to real-world situations and exploring how systems can be managed to promote and sustain resilience.<br><br> The book begins with an overview and introduction to resilience thinking and then takes the reader through the process of describing systems, assessing their resilience, and intervening as appropriate. Following each chapter is a case study of a different type of social-ecological system and how resilience makes a difference to that system in practice. The final chapters explore resilience in other arenas, including on a global scale.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Resilience Practice</i> will help people with an interest in the &#x201c;coping capacity&#x201d; of systems&#x2014;from farms and catchments to regions and nations&#x2014;to better understand how resilience thinking can be put into practice. It offers an easy-to-read but scientifically robust guide through the real-world application of the concept of resilience and is a must read for anyone concerned with the management of systems at any scale.</p><p>Brian Walker is a Research Fellow in Australia&#x2019;s CSIRO Ecosystem Sciences, Visiting Researcher in the Stockholm Resilience Centre, and Chair of the Resilience Alliance. David Salt is a science and environment writer at the Australian National University, and has more than two decades experience writing and producing popular science magazines and books. Both authors live in Canberra, Australia. <br>"Brian Walker and David Salt have written a thoughtful and powerful book to help resource users and managers put resilience thinking into practice and aim toward increasing the sustainability of our world. I urge public officials, scholars, and students in public policy programs to place this volume on their list of must-read books. It is a powerful antidote to the overly simplified proposals too often offered as solutions to contemporary problems at multiple scales." (Elinor Ostrom <i>Senior Research Director, Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis</i>)<br><br>"Since publication of the neat little classic <i>Resilience Thinking</i> in 2006, the core ideas of resilience have escaped most deliciously to seed thinking everywhere about moving beyond the linear paradigms that so often drive system breakdowns and crises. With <i>Resilience Practice</i>, Walker and Salt passionately extend their practical wisdom while ensuring that the rigorous tools people need to deploy resilience theory are not lost to colloquial useage." (Ken Wilson <i>Executive Director, The Christensen Fund</i>)<br><br>"Resilience is an important concept for managing Earth's life support systems. Yet practitioners complain that 'everyone talks about resilience, but no one knows how to manage it.' Walker and Salt provide a practical guide written in clear, simple language, with a rich endowment of examples. This is the most important book of the year for environmental managers and scientists." (Stephen R. Carpenter <i>Director and Professor, Center for Limnology, University of Wisconsin-Madison</i>)<br><br>"This was the answer I was looking for... This book is heavy on procedure and questions, both of which can be helpful to planners and managers for whom resilience planning is new territory." (<i>Natural Areas Journal</i>)<br><br>"<i>Resilience Practice</i> emerges as a readable, friendly guide to planetary preservation, intended to foster hope and corrective action in order to improve future prospects for a human-friendly Earth." (<i>BioScience</i>)<br><br>"...a classical handbook in resilience practice.

Howells Book Award of the American Anthropological Association</strong><br><br>How has bipedalism impacted human childbirth? Do PMS and postpartum depression have specific, maybe even beneficial, functions? These are only two of the many questions that specialists in evolutionary medicine seek to answer, and that anthropologist Wenda Trevathan addresses in <em>Ancient Bodies,</em> <em>Modern Lives</em>.<br> <br>Exploring a range of women's health issues that may be viewed through an evolutionary lens, specifically focusing on reproduction, Trevathan delves into issues such as the medical consequences of early puberty in girls, the impact of migration, culture change, and poverty on reproductive health, and how fetal growth retardation affects health in later life. Hypothesizing that many of the health challenges faced by women today result from a mismatch between how their bodies have evolved and the contemporary environments in which modern humans live, Trevathan sheds light on the power and potential of examining the human life cycle from an evolutionary perspective, and how this could improve our understanding of women's health and our ability to confront health challenges in more creative, effective ways.<br></p><p><br><strong>Wenda Trevathan, PhD</strong>, is the Regents Professor of Anthropology at New Mexico State University.

The skills they will learn with <b>MIPS Assembly Language Programming</b> offer a sound basis for advanced work in computer architectures and complex assembly languages. </p><p> This text is targeted for use in an introductory lower-division assembly language programming or computer organization course. After students are introduced to the MIPS architecture using this textbook, they will be well prepared to go on to more advanced courses in computer organization where any modern reduced instruction set computer (RISC) is analyzed. This text provides a technique that will make MIPS assembly language programming a relatively easy task as compared to writing complex Intel&#x2122; x86 assembly language code. The skills learned, as a MIPS assembly language programmer, will facilitate learning other more complex assembly languages if the need ever arises. Students using this text will acquire an understanding of how the functional components of modern computers are put together, and how a computer works at the machine language level. It is assumed that students using this text already have some experience in developing algorithms, and running programs in a high-level language. </p> <p> Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the basic MIPS architecture, which is a modern RISC. Chapter 2 shows how to develop code targeted to run on a MIPS processor using an intermediate pseudocode notation similar to the high-level language C. Once an algorithm is specified in this pseudocode notation it is a relatively simple task to translate it to MIPS assembly language. Chapter 3 is an introduction to the binary number system. This chapter provides simple procedures for converting values from one number system to another. The rules for performing binary arithmetic are explained. Students will learn how to detect when overflow occurs. Chapter 4 explains the features of the PCSpim simulator for the MIPS architecture, which is available for free. </p> <p> Within the remaining chapters, a wealth of programming exercises are provided that every student needs to become an accomplished assembly language programmer. Instructors are provided with a set of PowerPoint slides. After students have had an opportunity to develop their pseudocode and the corresponding MIPS assembly language code, they can be shown example solutions to each of the exercises via the PowerPoint slides. In Chapter 5, students are presented with the classical input/output (I/O) algorithms that involve converting numbers between their integer binary representation and their ASCII decimal and hexadecimal representation. The utility of logical operators and shift operators are stressed. </p> <p> In Chapter 6, a specific argument-passing protocol is defined. Most significant programming projects are a teamwork effort. Emphasis is placed on the important fact that everyone involved in a teamwork project must adopt the same convention for parameter passing when calling functions. In the case of nested function calls, a specific convention is defined for saving and restoring values in the temporary registers. </p> <p> In Chapter 7, the necessity for reentrant code is explained, as well as the rules one must follow to write such functions. In Chapter 8, students are introduced to memory-mapped I/O. The MIPS simulator provides a memory-mapped I/O feature so that students can gain experience in writing drivers that interface with physical devices. With this PCSpim feature, students can gain experience in writing code to communicate character by character with physical I/O devices. The code that communicates with a physical device at this level is often referred to as a driver. This is a significant advantage of using a simulator to learn assembly language programming. Students learning to write native assembly language typically never have an opportunity to write code that interfaces directly with the I/O devices. These students have to be satisfied with making calls to Basic Input Output System (BIOS) procedures that handle the details of communicating with the I/O devices. Typically these students never experience the real-world challenges that arise as a result of the communication and device time delays. </p> <p> Chapter 9 introduces exceptions and exception processing. PCSpim responds to interrupts generated by the memorymapped keyboard and display terminal. Given this feature, students have an opportunity to experience writing code to respond to interrupts. Once again this points out the advantage of using a simulator when learning to write assembly language code. Students learning to write assembly language code for their desktop computer typically never have an opportunity to write and run interrupt handlers that enable and disable the interrupt system. Typically these students never experience the real-world challenges that arise in writing the code that resides at the very heart of the operating system. </p> <p> In Chapter 10 a pipelined implementation of the MIPS architecture is presented, and the special programming considerations dealing with delayed loads and delayed branches are discussed. PCSpim provides an option to run the simulator as if the code were executing on a pipelined implementation of the MIPS architecture. Using this option, students gain experience in writing assembly language code that will run on a pipelined implementation. Chapter 11 provides a description of the floating-point features of the MIPS architecture, as well an introduction to the IEEE 754 floating-point standard. </p> <p> I would like to acknowledge Bary Pollack, James Gips, Doug Milhous, and Dwite Brown who adopted the earlier draft versions of this textbook.

In this book, Nussbaum argues that international political and economic thought must be sensitive to gender difference as a problem of justice, and that feminist thought must begin to focus on the problems of women in the third world. Taking as her point of departure the predicament of poor women in India, she shows how philosophy should undergird basic constitutional principles that should be respected and implemented by all governments, and used as a comparative measure of quality of life across nations. Nussbaum concludes by calling for a new international focus to feminism, and shows through concrete detail how philosophical arguments about justice really do connect with the practical concerns of public policy.

In <i>Life as Politics</i>, Asef Bayat argues that such presumptions fail to recognize the routine, yet important, ways in which ordinary people make meaningful change through everyday actions. First published just months before the Arab Spring swept across the region, this timely and prophetic book sheds light on the ongoing acts of protest, practice, and direct daily action. The second edition includes three new chapters on the Arab Spring and Iran's Green Movement and is fully updated to reflect recent events. At heart, the book remains a study of agency in times of constraint. In addition to ongoing protests, millions of people across the Middle East are effecting transformation through the discovery and creation of new social spaces within which to make their claims heard. This eye-opening book makes an important contribution to global debates over the meaning of social movements and the dynamics of social change.</p><p>Asef Bayat is the Catherine and Bruce Bastian Professor of Global and Transnational Studies and Professor of Sociology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is the author of <i>Making Islam Democratic: Social Movements and the Post-Islamist Turn</i> (Stanford, 2007)."Asef Bayat has penned a remarkable study. <i>Life as Politics</i> should be a mandatory read for any journalist, scholar or politician who has never been to the Middle East." (<i>Arab News</i>)<br><br>"<i>Life as Politics</i> offers a brilliant alternative perspective on public life by taking seriously the daily lives and the social agency of ordinary people." (<i>Middle East Book Reads</i>)<br><br>"When <i>Life as Politics</i> was published..., Asef Bayat's arguments on grassroots dynamism as the harbinger of democratic transformations in the Arab world seemed a utopian hope. Barely a year later, as events of the 2011 Arab Spring continue to unfold, his critical insights on everyday forms and spaces of political activity in the region have become prescient." (<i>Contemporary Sociology</i>)<br><br>"In <i>Life as Politics</i> Asef Bayat offers up a historically rich, analytically rigorous and conceptually innovative account of Middle East oppositional movements . . . [A] <i>tour de force</i> that will inspire as well as inform scholarship on Middle East social movements&#x2015;most importantly by moving beyond a preoccupation with 'exceptionalist' tendencies. Above all, this work establishes Asef Bayat as a virtuoso of the sociological imaginary. Specialist and non-specialist readers alike will find themselves transported to the streets of the Middle East and afforded a first-hand view of social and political activism in the making."

In <em>The Enigma of Capital,</em> he delivers an impassioned account of how unchecked neoliberalism produced the system-wide crisis that now engulfs the world. <br><br> Beginning in the 1970s, profitability pressures led the capitalist class in advanced countries to shift away from investment in industrial production at home toward the higher returns that financial products promised. Accompanying this was a shift towards privatization, an absolute decline in the bargaining power of labor, and the dispersion of production throughout the developing world. The decades-long and ongoing decline in wages that accompanied this turn produced a dilemma: how can goods--especially real estate--sell at the same rate as before if workers are making less in relative terms? The answer was a huge expansion of credit that fueled the explosive growth of both the financial industry and the real estate market. When one key market collapsed--real estate--the other one did as well, and social devastation resulted. <br><br> Harvey places today's crisis in the broadest possible context: the historical development of global capitalism itself from the industrial era onward. Moving deftly between this history and the unfolding of the current crisis, he concentrates on how such crises both devastate workers and create openings for challenging the system's legitimacy. The battle now will be between the still-powerful forces that want to reconstitute the system of yesterday and those that want to replace it with one that prizes social justice and economic equality. The new afterword focuses on the continuing impact of the crisis and the response to it in 2010.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Harvey</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He is among the top twenty most cited authors in the humanities and is the world's most cited academic geographer. His books include <em>The Limits to Capital, Social Justice and the City</em>, and <em>The Condition of Postmodernity</em>, among many others.<br>"At times of crisis," notes eminent Marxist geographer Harvey (Spaces of Global Capitalism), "the irrationality of capitalism becomes plain for all to see." Harvey excels at a revealing and constructive analysis of global capitalism at a moment when its integration--and the attendant widespread susceptibility to its disruptions and downturns--has never been tighter or the post&#x2013;cold war Western economic model for the world economy more discredited. The narrative delineates with admirable clarity the arcane details of the current financial crisis, while rehearsing the rise of capitalism as a historically specific "process" plagued by fundamental dilemmas. A Marxist perspective comes augmented and nuanced by wide reference to scholarship, close readings of Marx and Engels, and instructive examples of capitalism�s basic tendencies in episodes like Henry Ford�s notorious Fordlandia venture in the Amazon. While certain to be controversial even on the broad left, Harvey�s analysis joins other recent attempts (such as Raj Patel�s The Value of Nothing) to re-think the current economic and political regime from its roots, while identifying and variously championing ready alternatives already manifesting themselves within it. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their secret was not racial, or cultural, or institutional superiority but a resonant intersection of historical changes, including the sudden rise of mass transfer across oceans and mountains, a revolutionary upward shift in attitudes to emigration, the emergence of a settler 'boom mentality', and a late flowering of non-industrial technologies -wind, water, wood, and work animals - especially on settler frontiers. This revolution combined with the Industrial Revolution to transform settlement into something explosive - capable of creating great cities like Chicago and Melbourne and large socio-economies in a single generation. <br><br>When the great settler booms busted, as they always did, a second pattern set in. Links between the Anglo-wests and their metropolises, London and New York, actually tightened as rising tides of staple products flowed one way and ideas the other. This 're-colonization' re-integrated Greater America and Greater Britain, bulking them out to become the superpowers of their day. The 'Settler Revolution' was not exclusive to the Anglophone countries - Argentina, Siberia, and Manchuria also experienced it. But it was the Anglophone settlers who managed to integrate frontier and metropolis most successfully, and it was this that gave them the impetus and the material power to provide the world's leading super-powers for the last 200 years. <br><br>This book will reshape understandings of American, British, and British dominion hi</p><p><br><strong>James Belich</strong> is professor of history at the Stout Research Centre, Victoria University of Wellington.

Some of what they contained was wildly heretical and alchemically obsessed, hinting at a Newton altogether stranger and less palatable than the one enshrined in Westminster Abbey as the paragon of English rationality. These manuscripts had the potential to undermine not merely Newton's reputation, but that of the scientific method he embodied. They were immediately suppressed as "unfit to be printed," and, aside from brief, troubling glimpses spread across centuries, the papers would remain hidden from sight for more than seven generations.<br><br>In<em> The Newton Papers</em>, Sarah Dry illuminates the tangled history of these private writings over the course of nearly three hundred years, from the long span of Newton's own life into the present day. The writings, on subjects ranging from secret alchemical formulas to impassioned rejections of the Holy Trinity, would eventually come to light as they moved through the hands of relatives, collectors, and scholars. The story of their disappearance, dispersal, and rediscovery is populated by a diverse cast of characters who pursued and possessed the papers, from economist John Maynard Keynes to controversial Jewish Biblical scholar Abraham Yahuda. Dry's captivating narrative moves between these varied personalities, depicting how, as they chased the image of Newton through the thickets of his various obsessions, these men became obsessed themselves with the allure of defining the "true" Newton. <br><br>Dry skillfully accounts for the ways with which Newton's pursuers have approached his papers over centuries. Ultimately, <em>The Newton Papers</em> shows how Newton has been made and re-made throughout history by those seeking to reconcile the cosmic contradictions of an extraordinarily complex man.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sarah Dry</strong> is the author of <em>Curie: A Life</em> and has also written on epidemics, global health, and the history of meteorology.

Sarah Dry's book makes us appreciate the twists and turns by which the papers came down to us, and in the process offers a fascinating account of how attitudes about what can be learned from such collections of private, unpublished material have evolved over the centuries."--George E. Smith, Tufts University<p></p><br>"The fascinating saga of Newton's Papers illuminates a battle waged across several centuries over the legacy and image of England's greatest man of science. At stake was evidence, truth, rationality, religious belief, national pride, but also the physical ownership of Newton's material and intellectual remnants. Sarah Dry has crafted a wonderful canvas, stretching across several continents and peopled by myriad scientists and popularizers, collectors and politicians, aristocratic families and impoverished relatives. This is a beautifully written book, sure to please and captivate the connoisseur and novice alike."--Diana Kormos-Buchwald, The Einstein Papers Project, California Institute of Technology<p></p><br>"An engaging narrative of the fortunes of the towering mathematician's Nachlass--his <br>private papers...

Accessible to students in both biology and computer science, it strikes a unique balance between rigorous mathematics and practical techniques, emphasizing the ideas underlying algorithms rather than offering a collection of apparently unrelated problems. The book introduces biological and algorithmic ideas together, linking issues in computer science to biology and thus capturing the interest of students in both subjects. It demonstrates that relatively few design techniques can be used to solve a large number of practical problems in biology, and presents this material intuitively. <i>An Introduction to Bioinformatics Algorithms </i>is one of the first books on bioinformatics that can be used by students at an undergraduate level. It includes a dual table of contents, organized by algorithmic idea and biological idea; discussions of biologically relevant problems, including a detailed problem formulation and one or more solutions for each; and brief biographical sketches of leading figures in the field. These interesting vignettes offer students a glimpse of the inspirations and motivations for real work in bioinformatics, making the concepts presented in the text more concrete and the techniques more approachable.PowerPoint presentations, practical bioinformatics problems, sample code, diagrams, demonstrations, and other materials can be found at the Author's website.</p></p><p>Neil C.

With more than 1,100 poems, it is the most varied and comprehensive selection of traditional Japanese poetry now available in English.<br>Ezra Pound called poetry "the most concentrated form of verbal expression," and the great poets of Japan wrote poems as charged and compressed as poems can be. The Japanese language, with its few consonates and even fewer vowels, did not lend itself to expansive forms, making small seem better and perhaps more powerful. There is also the historical context in which Japanese poetry developed&#x2015;the highly refined society of the early courts of Nara and Kyoto. In this setting, poetry came to be used as much for communication between lovers and friends as for artistic expression, and a tradition of cryptic statement evolved, with notes passed from sleeve to sleeve or conundrums exchanged furtively in the night.<br>Add to this the high sense of decorum that dominated court society for centuries, and you have the conditions that led to the development of the classical <i>uta</i> (also referred to as <i>tanka</i> or <i>waka</i>), the thrity-one-syllable form that acts as the foundation for virtually all poetry written in Japanese between 850 and 1900.<br>In choosing poems, the compiler has given priority to authors and works gnerally acknowledged as of great artistic and/or historical importance by Japanese scholars. For this reason, major poets such as Kakinomoto no Hitomaro, Izumi Shikibu, Saigyo, and Matsuo Basho are particualarly important collections such as Man'yoshu, Kokinshu, and Shin kokinshu. In addtion, the volume also contains samplings from genres such as the poetic diary, linked verse, Chinese forms, and comic verse.</p><p>Text: English (translation)&#39;A collection of excellent translations of Japanese poetry ...

However, due to a lack of state-of-the-art guidance, most firms still aren't achieving the substantial end-to-end supply chain, profit and shareholder value improvements that this process can help deliver. This comprehensive guide delineates how to accomplish successful top management planning using a step-by-step approach and explains how to implement and execute robust S&amp;OP process excellence. It details the ease with which S&amp;OP can be implemented and how it can be done correctly with little capital while still returning many times the investment.

The biological domain is organised as an interdependent hierarchy of processes, which are stabilized and actively maintained at different timescales. Even entities that intuitively appear to be paradigms of things, such as organisms, are actually better understood as processes. Unlike previous attempts to articulate processual views of biology, which have tended to use Alfred North Whitehead's panpsychist metaphysics as a foundation, this book takes a naturalistic approach to metaphysics. It submits that the main motivations for replacing an ontology of substances with one of processes are to be found in the empirical findings of science. Biology provides compelling reasons for thinking that the living realm is fundamentally dynamic, and that the existence of things is always conditional on the existence of processes. The phenomenon of life cries out for theories that prioritise processes over things, and it suggests that the central explanandum of biology is not change but rather stability, or more precisely, stability attained through constant change. This edited volume brings together philosophers of science and metaphysicians interested in exploring the prospects of a processual philosophy of biology. The contributors draw on an extremely wide range of biological case studies, and employ a process perspective to cast new light on a number of traditional philosophical problems, such as identity, persistence, and individuality.<br></p><p><br><strong>Daniel J.

Indeed, what attracted Western readers' interest was the Zen rejection of ritual. The famous 'Beat Zen' writers were delighted by the Zen emphasis on spontaneity as opposed to planned, repetitious action, and wrote inspirationally about the demythologized, anti-ritualized spirit of Zen. Quotes from the great Zen masters supported this understanding of Zen, and led to the fervor that fueled the opening of Zen centers throughout the West.<br> <br> Once Western practitioners in these centers began to practice Zen seriously, however, they discovered that zazen - Zen meditation - is a ritualized practice supported by centuries-old ritual practices of East Asia. Although initially in tension with the popular anti-ritual image of ancient Zen masters, interest in Zen ritual has increased along with awareness of its fundamental role in the spirit of Zen. Eventually, Zen practitioners would form the idea of no-mind, or the open and awakened state of mind in which ingrained habits of thinking give way to more receptive, direct forms of experience. This notion provides a perspective from which ritual could gain enormous respect as a vehicle to spiritual awakening, and thus this volume seeks to emphasize the significance of ritual in Zen practice.<br> <br> Containing 9 articles by prominent scholars about a variety of topics, including Zen rituals kinhin and zazen, this volume covers rituals from the early Chan period to modern Japan. Each chapter covers key developments that occurred in the Linji/Rinzai and Caodon/ Soto schools of China and Japan, describing how Zen rituals mold the lives and characters of its practitioners, shaping them in accordance with the ideal of Zen awakening. This volume is a significant step towards placing these practices in a larger historical and analytical perspective.<br></p><p><br><strong>Steven Heine</strong> is Professor of Religious Studies and History and Director of the Institute for Asian Studies at Florida International University. <strong>Dale S.

The writers explore a range of ritual activities in the tradition, including rituals to protect the emperor and the country, formulaic sermons, seated and walking meditation, empowerment and healing rituals conducted by nuns, and a dharma-transmission ceremony recently formulated for North American Zen. This volume fills an important lacuna in Zen Studies, and it merits a close reading by anyone interested in ritual, Buddhism, or East Asian cultures." --Christopher Ives, author of <em>Zen Awakening and Society</em><p></p><br>"<em>Zen Ritual</em> is an excellent volume and should be of great interest to scholars of East Asian Buddhism, be useful in upper-level undergraduate courses, and may also challenge Western Zen practictioners to further refine and define their own traditions <em>vis-a-vis</em> Japanese Zen.

Andrew Louth aims to redress the balance. Recognizing that the intellectual form of this tradition was decisively influenced by Platonic ideas of the soul&#39;s relationship to God, Louth begins with an examination of Plato and Platonism. The discussion of the Fathers which follows shows how the mystical tradition is at the heart of their thought and how the dogmatic tradition both molds and is the reflection of mystical insights and concerns. This new edition of a classic study of the diverse influences upon Christian spirituality includes a new Epilogue which brings the text completely up to date.</p><p>One reviewer of this book wrote, "it is not often that we chance to meet with a book so rich that it would be impossible to discuss it in full without writing another one at least as long." Originally given as a series of lectures in the Faculty of Theology at the Oxford University, <i>The Origins of the Christian Mystical Tradition</i> is a superb introduction to the sometimes fog-filled subject of Christian mysticism. Focusing on the early centuries of the faith, Louth first explores the influence of Plato and Platonism on Christian writers, and then devotes individual chapters to key theologians: Athanasius and Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine, and Denys the Areopagite, also known as Pseudo-Dionysius. In his final two chapters he looks at the relationship between the mysticism of the early church fathers and that of St. John of the Cross, perhaps the most influential mystic in the history of the church, and he explores the distinctive character of Christian mysticism. <p> While challenging reading, Louth is a clear and straightforward thinker and writer. <i>The Origins of the Christian Mystical Tradition</i> will lead the discerning reader onto a path through some of the most exciting and ecstatic spiritual writing in any tradition. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p><br>Andrew Louth is Professor of Patristic and Byzantine Studies, University of Durham.<br></p><h2>Handbook of Principles of Organizational Behavior: Indispensable Knowledge for Evidence-Based Management</h2><p>There is a strong movement today in management to encourage management practices based on research evidence. In the first volume of this handbook, I asked experts in 39 areas of management to identify a central principle that summarized and integrated the core findings from their specialty area and then to explain this principle and give real business examples of the principle in action. I asked them to write in non-technical terms, e.g., without a lot of statistics, and almost all did so. <p>The previous handbook proved to be quite popular, so I was asked to edit a second edition. This new edition has been expanded to 33 topics, and there are some new authors for the previously included topics. The new edition also includes: updated case examples, updated references and practical exercises at the end of each chapter. It also includes a preface on evidence-based management. The principles for the first edition were intended to be relatively timeless, so it is no surprise that most of the principles are the same (though some chapter titles include more than one principle).</p> <p>This book could serve as a textbook in advanced undergraduate and in MBA courses. It could also be of use to practicing managers and not just those in Human Resource departments. Every practicing manager may not want to read the whole book, but I am willing to guarantee that every one will find at least one or more chapters that will be practically useful. In this time of economic crisis, the need for effective management practices is more acute than ever.</p></p><p>"What can be done to provide practicing managers with what they need to know and to equip students with the knowledge and skills that will enhance their chances of career success? Ed Locke takes a positive step forward toward answering this question in the selections he has chosen for this new edition. The readings are by experts in their field and each updates scientific research, followed by exercises and activities for applying this evidence to further the goal of developing useful knowledge. <p>Locke's book demonstrates how we need to build knowledge by rigorous research and replication to produce sound principles to guide our thinking and decision making. These principles ask us to check our premises, the values and assumptions we make about the art and science of management. This forces us to understand the decision context, to set priorities, and to move forward intelligently. In this way we can avoid fads and develop an improved, actionable body of knowledge."<br> &#x2014;<b>Daniel A. Wren, David Ross Boyd Professor Emeritus, Curator, H.W. Bass Business History Collection, University of Oklahoma</b></p> <p>"Five key adjectives describe this Handbook: 1) It is important because it deals with fundamental topics in organizational behavior and related areas; 2) it is comprehensive because it covers the array of major areas in the field such as selection, training, motivation, team dynamics, and leadership; 3) it is authoritative because the authors of its chapters are many of the leading researchers and scholars in the field; 4) it is current because the chapters incorporate the latest research findings; and, especially 5) it is useful &#x2013; to both practitioners interested in potential guidelines for policies and actions, as well as to students and faculty teaching and carrying out research in these areas. Highly recommended on all counts."<br> &#x2014;<b>Lyman W. Porter, University of California, Irvine</b></p> <p>"This is a jewel of a book for practitioners seeking to apply evidence-based principles of behavior in organizations.</p> <p>Readers can absorb more by perusing the chapter titles of this handbook than sifting through dozens of pages of research articles. Each chapter expands on the principle espoused in its title, putting flesh on the bones without losing its theme and direction. The chapters stand alone yet connect in mutually reinforcing ways.</p> <p>Without ignoring contingencies or nuanced insight, these compact syntheses of research on organizational behavior get right to the point. Each chapter is a springboard from which practitioners can make informed decisions and craft fruitful actions.</p> <p>In compiling this volume, Ed Locke has purposefully abandoned mind-numbing catalogs of facts and details in favor of distilling evidence-based principles of human behavior in organizations that students can readily remember and managers can directly apply. Once again he demonstrates that generating complexity is far easier&#x2014;and far less useful&#x2014;than finding the essential among disparate streams of research evidence."<br> &#x2014;<b>Ann Howard Ph.D, Development Dimensions International, Inc.

We speak of authentic art, music, food, dance, and people. Authenticity can be found in moments of extreme danger, in the pleasures of carnival, in the taste of champagne. As anthropologist Charles Lindholm shows in this engaging new book, the hope for an authentic experience draws us to charismatic leaders, expressive artists, and social movements; it makes us into trendy consumers, creative performers, and fanatical collectors. It also can lead to the bloodshed of ethnic cleansing. <p>In <i>Culture and Authenticity</i>, Lindholm argues that the pervasive desire for authenticity is a consequence of a modern loss of faith and meaning. Authenticity, in its many guises, offers seekers a sense of belonging, connection and solidity. Yet, even as authenticity has become more valued, it has become more elusive and remote. Calling upon anthropological case studies from different cultures, historical material, and comparative philosophy, he explores how notions of authenticity develop, what forms it takes, and how it changes over time. This exciting text takes us on a journey of the human quest for the authentic, and how it has been imagined, described, analyzed, and realized by individuals and collectives.</p><b>Charles Lindholm</b> is a University Professor of Anthropology at Boston University.

Amid concerns about rising rates of obesity and diabetes, unpronounceable ingredients, and the environmental footprint of industrial agriculture, food reformers implore parents to slow down, cook from scratch, and gather around the dinner table. Making food a priority, they argue, will lead to happier and healthier families. But is it really that simple? <br><br>In this riveting and beautifully-written book, Sarah Bowen, Joslyn Brenton, and Sinikka Elliott take us into the kitchens of nine women to tell the complicated story of what it takes to feed a family today. All of these mothers love their children and want them to eat well. But their kitchens are not equal. From cockroach infestations and stretched budgets to picky eaters and conflicting nutrition advice, <em>Pressure Cooker</em> exposes how modern families struggle to confront high expectations and deep-seated inequalities around getting food on the table.<br><br>Based on extensive interviews and field research in the homes and kitchens of a diverse group of American families, <em>Pressure Cooker</em> challenges the logic of the most popular foodie mantras of our time, showing how they miss the mark and up the ante for parents and children. Romantic images of family meals are inviting, but they create a fiction that does little to fix the problems in the food system. The unforgettable stories in this book evocatively illustrate how class inequality, racism, sexism, and xenophobia converge at the dinner table. If we want a food system that is fair, equitable, and nourishing, we must look outside the kitchen for answers.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sarah Bowen</strong> is Associate Professor of Sociology at North Carolina State University.

Before Stonewall&#x2015;when homosexuals were still deemed mentally ill&#x2015;these bars were the only place where many could have any community at all. <em>Baby, You are My Religion</em> explores this community as a site of a lived corporeal theology and political space. It reveals that religious institutions such as the Metropolitan Community Church were founded in such bars, that traditional and non-traditional religious activities took place there, and that religious ceremonies such as marriage were often conducted within the bars by staff. Baby<em>, You are My Religion</em> examines how these bars became not only ecclesiastical sites but also provided the fertile ground for the birth of the struggle for gay and lesbian civil rights before Stonewall.</p><p><p><strong>Marie Cartier</strong> is a scholar, visual /performance artist, queer activist, poet and theologian who has been active in many movements for social change.

It presents an introductory sketch of Pali using both European and South Asian grammatical categories. In English-language works, Pali is usually presented in the traditional terms of English grammar, derived from the classical tradition, with which many modern students are unfamiliar. This work discusses and reflects upon those categories, and has an appendix devoted to them. It also introduces the main categories of traditional Sanskrit and Pali grammar, drawing on, in particular, the medieval Pali text Saddaniti, by Aggavamsa. Each grammatical form is illustrated by examples taken from Pali texts, mostly canonical. Although some previous knowledge of Sanskrit would be helpful, the book can also be used by those without previous linguistic training. A bibliographical appendix refers to other, complementary resources.</p><p>Steven Collins is profess of of South Asian languages and civilizations at the University of Chicago, and was formerly a council member of the Pali Text Society (London).

However, because of their prevalence and mundane nature, we tend not to pay much attention to them, let alone examine their significance. Western aesthetic theories of the past few centuries also neglect everyday aesthetics because of their almost exclusive emphasis on art. In a ground-breaking new study, Yuriko Saito provides a detailed investigation into our everyday aesthetic experiences, and reveals how our everyday aesthetic tastes and judgments can exert a powerful influence on the state of the world and our quality of life. By analysing a wide range of examples from our aesthetic interactions with nature, the environment, everyday objects, and Japanese culture, Saito illustrates the complex nature of seemingly simple and innocuous aesthetic responses. She discusses the inadequacy of art-centered aesthetics, the aesthetic appreciation of the distinctive characters of objects or phenomena, responses to various manifestations of transience, and the aesthetic expression of moral values; and she examines the moral, political, existential, and environmental implications of these and other issues.</p><p><br><em>Yuriko Saito</em> is Professor of Philosophy at the Rhode Island School of Design.<br><br>"<em>Everyday Aesthetics</em> is a well-argued and ground-breaking piece of philosophy which has much to say about issues in contemporary philosophy of art and design theory while also helping to form a new sub-discipline within aesthetics.

Placing parties in a broad historical context and shedding light on their connection to other parts of the American political system, Sidney Milkis argues that, beginning with the New Deal, reforms intended to liberate the chief executive from the shackles of partisan politics only weakened an already fragile relationship, isolating presidents from what was once popular and institutional support from their parties. Written for political science students at all levels, this comprehensive analysis covers a broad range of issues and events, including FDR's 1938 "Purge" of the Democratic Party, The Executive Reorganization Act of 1939, the legacy of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, and the triumph of executive centralization during the Reagan "Revolution." By providing a unique perspective on the elements of American government, Milkis offers new insights into the decline of the party system and the process that fashioned a stronger, more active national state, but one lacking in vital representative institutions capable of common deliberation and choice. Placing the issue in contemporary perspective, he warns of the challenges ahead for a nation struggling to repair its frayed connection between government and people.<br></p><p>&#39;Shows how the growth of the presidential power in the twentieth century created a politics of administration that has supplanted a vigorous party politics.

White America, in Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.&#x2019;s words, is "poisoned to its soul" by racism, and we are equally haunted by <i>not </i>listening to our black sisters and brothers, past and present. Such listening would be one way to help purge our souls of racism&#x2019;s poison through empathetic witnessing, a form of <i>archetypal apology</i>, if you will. To do so, we need to counter white fragility by having the strength to turn the pages of books like <i>Archetypal Grief</i>, and not look away from the anguish and anger therein, nor deny our ancestors&#x2019; roles in their genesis and the <i>archetypal guilt</i> we carry in our DNA as well." - <strong>Jennifer Leigh Selig, PhD</strong>, author of <i>Integration: The Psychology and Mythology of Martin Luther King, Jr. and His (Unfinished) Therapy With the Soul of America</i></p> <p>"Fanny Brewster provides a necessary exploration of the impact on African-Americans of a devastating evil of slavery, the tearing of children away from their mothers. She writes with passion and power, using the lens of Jungian archetypes in conjunction with her profound understanding of African-American culture, to decipher the complexities of slavery&#x2019;s aftermath. Considering past, future, and spiritual integrity, she leads us to an understanding of feelings that still reverberate, archetypal grief as a steady-state, pervasive element over a lifetime, within a culture of resilience and survival." - <strong>Merle Molofsky, NCPsyA, LP</strong>, psychoanalyst, faculty member and Advisory Board, Harlem Family Institute, USA; faculty member, NPAP</p> <p>"Fanny Brewster throws open the doors of the slave quarters, casts light on the face of unbearable grief, rage and intergenerational trauma. She insists we remember what the culture, and indeed, Depth Psychology, has preferred to forget&#x2015;the appalling cruelty and systemic evil of American slavery during the 400 years of the African Holocaust, how its social and psychological legacy shapes our world to this day.</p> <p></p> <p>The Ancestors speak to Brewster, especially "mothering slaves"&#x2015;women forced to be "breeders," whose labor in childbirth and in the cotton fields brought them no joy, no increase, no profit. Their bodies were not their own; they were used and abused. Their children were not their own; they were ripped from their breasts. Their families were not their own; they were torn apart. They tell Motherline stories from hell.</p><i> <p></p> </i><p><i>Archetypal Grief</i> is strong medicine for the soul. If your heart is open to sorrow, to horror, if your mind is open to seeing through cultural complexes and denial, if your ears are open to "the voice of the Other," if you long for healing, if you want to "be woke," this book is for you." - <strong>Naomi Ruth Lowinsky</strong>, author of <i>The Motherline: Every Woman&#x2019;s Journey to Find Her Female Roots </i>and <i>The Rabbi, the Goddesss and Jung: Getting the Word from Within</i></p> <p>"You birth a child and they die because you are malnourished. You birth a child knowing they are the product of a rape. You birth a child and at adolescence they are maimed, tortured or flogged to death. You birth a child and they are torn from your arms and sold you know not where. </p> <p></p> <p>This is the archetypal legacy of the African Holocaust explored by Jungian analyst Dr. Fanny Brewster who challenges us to become conscious of the grief, sorrow, rage as well as the strength and resilience experienced and embedded in the emotional DNA of those "<i>mothering slaves</i>" and handed down to their descendants. The trauma of this legacy affects all and is embedded in all our psyches.</p> <p></p> <p>Bring your heart and your soul, your emotions as well as your intellect as you read this searing, scholarly work." - <strong>Christine M.

Impassioned debate over situations as diverse as the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Eli�n Gonz�les affair is characteristic not only of modern times but of centuries of Cuban history. In this concise and up-to-date book, British journalist Richard Gott casts a fresh eye on the history of the Caribbean island from its pre-Columbian origins to the present day. He provides a European perspective on a country that is perhaps too frequently seen solely from the American point of view.<br><br> The author emphasizes such little-known aspects of Cuba&#x2019;s history as its tradition of racism and violence, its black rebellions, the survival of its Indian peoples, and the lasting influence of Spain. The book also offers an original look at aspects of the Revolution, including Castro&#x2019;s relationship with the Soviet Union, military exploits in Africa, and his attempts to promote revolution in Latin America and among American blacks.

But relatively few have examined precisely <i>how</i> such poverty affects social capital or have considered for what reasons living in a poor neighborhood results in such undesirable effects.<br><br>This book examines a neglected Puerto Rican enclave in Boston to consider the pros and cons of social scientific thinking about the true nature of ghettos in America. Mario Luis Small dismantles the theory that poor urban neighborhoods are inevitably deprived of social capital. He shows that the conditions specified in this theory are vaguely defined and variable among poor communities. According to Small, structural conditions such as unemployment or a failed system of familial relations <i>must</i> be acknowledged as affecting the urban poor, but individual motivations and the importance of timing must be considered as well.<br><br>Brimming with fresh theoretical insights, <i>Villa Victoria</i> is an elegant work of sociology that will be essential to students of urban poverty.</p><p><b>Mario Luis Small</b> is associate professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago."This sociological study challenges much of the traditional wisdom about the dynamics of ghetto life. . . .

This book focuses attention primarily on the physical aspects of the binding and its construction principles. It is an expanded version of a series of lectures delivered by the author while Visiting Professor at the University of Amsterdam in 1987, supplemented with the results of ten years of intensive research in major libraries on the Continent, the United Kingdom and the USA. It surveys the evolution of binding structures from the introduction of the codex two thousand years ago to the close of the Middle Ages. Part I reviews the scanty physical evidence from the Mediterranean heritage, the early Coptic, Islamic and Ethiopian binding structures and their interrelation with those of the Byzantine realm. Part II is devoted to a detailed analysis of Western binding techniques, distinguishing the carolingian, romanesque and gothic wooden-board bindings as the main typological entities; their structure and function is compared with those of contemporary limp bindings. The book is illustrated with over 200 drawings and photographs and contains a comprehensive bibliography.</p><p>Professor J.A.Szirmai spent twenty years in medical research before becoming a professional designer bookbinder and later a scholar in the history of binding techniques.&#39;Dr Szirmai has filled gap of long standing in the history of the book. No comprehensive study of medieval bookbinding structure exists and certainly not one that is so detailed and wide ranging... An excellent and extensive bibliography and a detailed index contribute to making this a first-rate work of reference... above all, this is the sort of book that is only produced once in a generation, if that often. All book historians owe Dr Szirmai an enormous debt of gratitude for having written it.&#39; The Library &#39;While comparisons are not possible with a book which stands alone in its scope and scrupulous presentation of its material, it can be said that more than anything published so far in this field, it stands as a statement of what is currently known of the subject... a mine of information, much of which is either available nowhere else or in journals or languages not accessible to any but the most dedicated researchers. It deserves to be on the shelves of any individual or institution that concerns itself with the medieval book.&#39; Nicholas Pickwood, TLS &#39;... a book literally without peer... It is this passionate interest that has enabled (Szirmai) to assemble this remarkable history...&#39; Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America &#39;Le &#39;Szirmai&#39; sera incontournable pour tout etudiant manuscrit.&#39; Veronika von Buren, Aevum &#39;... a work of great scholarship.&#39; Bookbinder &#39;... [a] major contribution to the study of bookbinding... Szirmai&#39;s book [...] is the first to offer a comprehensive account of binding structures; from sewing, through edge trimming, to fastenings and furnishings... The detail, like the coverage, is astonishing... an absolute must for any library concerned with the art, history, and science of the book.&#39; ARLIS &#39;Every book restorer should be familiar with the knowledge in The Archaeology of Medieval Bookbinding... It should be available to every book restorer as an indispensable handbook... The book is a standard work for the evolution of binding techniques and therefore it should not be missing in any professional library.&#39; Papier Restaurierung &#39;Succinct and organized, fully and lucidly illustrated, Szirmai&#39;s book includes thorough documentation and an excellent subject index.&#39; Choice &#39;Szirmai deserves our indebtedness for a magisterial work which constitutes a milestone in the field of the archaeology of the book, qualifying the author as the first true archaeologist of the binding structure.&#39; CABNewsletter &#39;As the first scholarly work to treat medieval bookbindings from the standpoint of the book-as-object, The Archaeology of Medieval Bookbinding sheds new light on the making of early books, and offers many insights into this subject. Throughout, Szirmai contests much conventional wisdom... Szirmai&#39;s meticulous account will surely become essential reading for everyone responsible for the safekeeping of medieval books and their bindings.&#39; NPO Journal &#39;Every aspect of this book is superb: The scholarship is meticulous, the language clear and graceful, the diagrams of structures are right there whenever a point needs to be illustrated, and the book itself is well printed (in Plantin, on acid-free paper) and well bound... Each chapter has voluminous notes, and there is a long bibliography and detailed index... This is a technical book that is hard to put down. Reading it, and then trying to describe it to another person is like trying to describe the Grand Canyon to someone who has never seen it: in the end, you can only say, &#34;You had to be there to understand.&#34;&#39; Abbey Newsletter &#39;The author should be congratulated with the publication of this book, written with an extraordinary clarity, accessible to both learned codicologists and practising restorers... Finally, it should be clearly stated that it would be highly desirable to have this book translated into Russian, since no work of this scope with such significance for both restorers and archaeologists has ever been published here.&#39; Restoration of Museak Treasures &#39;The monograph is a unique synthesis of a lifelong experience, a thorough study of literature and of the documentation of extensive fieldwork. In addition to these fundamental values it is extremely significant for the methodology and the terminology. Invaluable also is the bibliography, comprising 604 items on 26 pages.&#39; Arts and Crafts, Prague &#39;... very readable and excellently illustrated narrative that leaves the student with a compelling interest in the meaning of early bookbindings and a poignant appreciation of the uncertainties of their survival.&#39; Libraries and Culture &#39;Dr Szirmai&#39;s book is strikingly complete, concise, and balanced; even where I thought I knew the primary sources well, I found my understanding of them was improved after using this book. The Archaeology of Medieval Bookbinding is the most important single contribution to the history of bookbinding to appear for many decades, and should be a foundation-piece in any collection of books on the history of binding or binding structure.&#39; Guild of Booksellers Newsletter</p><h2>Algebra Survival Guide Workbook: Thousands of Problems To Sharpen Skills and Enhance Understanding</h2><p>Following on the success of the Algebra Survival Guide, the Algebra Survival Guide Workbook presents thousands of practice problems (and all answers) to help children master algebra.

Yet there was a time when curiosity was condemned. Neither Pandora nor Eve could resist the dangerous allure of unanswered questions, and all knowledge wasn&#x2019;t equal&#x2014;for millennia it was believed that there were some things we should not try to know. In the late sixteenth century this attitude began to change dramatically, and in <i>Curiosity: </i><i>How Science Became Interested in Everything, </i>Philip Ball investigates how curiosity first became sanctioned&#x2014;when it changed from a vice to a virtue and how it became permissible to ask any and every question about the world.&nbsp;Looking closely at the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries, Ball vividly brings to life the age when modern science began, a time that spans the lives of Galileo and Isaac Newton. In this entertaining and illuminating account of the rise of science as we know it, Ball tells of scientists both legendary and lesser known, from Copernicus and Kepler to Robert Boyle, as well as the inventions and technologies that were inspired by curiosity itself, such as the telescope and the microscope. The so-called Scientific Revolution is often told as a story of great geniuses illuminating the world with flashes of inspiration. But <i>Curiosity</i> reveals a more complex story, in which the liberation&#x2014;and subsequent taming&#x2014;of curiosity was linked to magic, religion, literature, travel, trade, and empire. Ball also asks what has become of curiosity today: how it functions in science, how it is spun and packaged for consumption, how well it is being sustained, and how the changing shape of science influences the kinds of questions it may continue to ask.&nbsp;Though proverbial wisdom tell us that it was through curiosity that our innocence was lost, that has not deterred us. Instead, it has been completely the contrary: today we spend vast sums trying to reconstruct the first instants of creation in particle accelerators, out of a pure desire to <i>know</i>. Ball refuses to let us take this desire for granted, and this book is a perfect homage to such an inquisitive attitude.<br></p><p><b>Philip Ball</b> is a freelance writer who lives in London. He worked for over twenty years as an editor for <i>Nature</i>, writes regularly in the scientific and popular media, and has authored many books on the interactions of the sciences, the arts, and the wider culture, including, most recently, <i>Serving the Reich: The Struggle for the Soul of Physics under Hitler</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press<i>.</i><br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Philip Ball&#x2019;s fascinating book revels not just in the experiments of these early scientists, but also in their humanity, foibles and passions. Curiosity may lead us down blind alleys as often as it enlightens, but Ball shows that it is a vital part of what makes us human.&#x201d; (<i>Sunday Times (UK)</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Curiosity</i> emerges as a first-rate popular account of how science in Europe began. Accurate, witty, and reliable, the book ably shows modern readers how we got to be modern. Philip Ball adeptly sketches the virtuoso sensibility: a combination of intellectual nosiness and experimental dexterity plus the belief that, as he writes, &#x2018;to understand everything, you could start from anywhere.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Curiosity </i>is a wonderful book that revises popular assumptions about the Scientific Revolution with great wit and insight. . . . Philip Ball wants to retain the excitement and fervor that drove scientific curiosity from the seventeenth century onwards and celebrate the &#x2018;love, the awe, the passion&#x2019; that scientists feel but repress in their research because of the curious history of scientific experimentation. In this, Ball distinguishes himself as unquestionably one of our finest&#x2014;and most curious&#x2014;writers on the history and future of science." (<i>Literary Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Offers a wide-ranging account of what used to be called the scientific revolution&#x2014;a term that historians of science now tend to use at arm&#x2019;s length, wrapping it in quotation marks, for fear of sounding simplistic (or, even worse, triumphalist). Almost everyone of importance between Copernicus and Newton is discussed here, and a great deal of information is imparted in a user-friendly and thought-provoking way.&#x201d; (<i>Telegraph</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A wonderfully nuanced and wise study of the scientific revolution. . . . Philip Ball shows that there wasn't just one kind of science in the 17th century: Bacon, Galileo, Boyle and Newton were all doing different things, appropriate to their respective disciplines.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Guardian (UK)</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;To explain the shift that transformed curiosity from a dangerous temptation to a praiseworthy motivation, Ball revisits the intellectually restless lives of great scientists across the centuries, including Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton. But readers soon learn that the work of investing curiosity with a new and positive value also involved astrologers, magicians, courtiers, and mystics. . . . As the story of how a strange coalition of revolutionaries defied traditional restraints on the hunger for new knowledge, Ball&#x2019;s history of curiosity tells readers much about the dangerous adventure of being a modern human.&#x201d; (<i>Booklist, starred review</i>)<br><br>"Philip Ball possesses the gift of making complicated topics compelling <i>and</i> understandable. A substantial work in the history of science, this engaging title should appeal to serious readers, both academic and armchair.&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;When we think of curiosity as a motivator for research, quirky or otherwise, we&#x2019;re assuming a modern definition for the term, something along the lines of 'a desire to know or learn.' And one of the first things we discover in Philip Ball&#x2019;s engaging, meticulously detailed and abundantly entertaining history <i>Curiosity: How Science Became Interested in Everything</i> is that the word has had many connotations through the ages. . . .

I highly recommend <i>Curiosity </i>for anyone interested in science.&#x201d; (<i>Chemical Heritage</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Curiosity: How Science Became Interested in Everything</i>, the science writer Ball, a former editor at <i>Nature</i>, reveals how curiosity, combined with wonder, has driven the scientific enterprise since the seventeenth century, and how the ever-transmuting nature of curiosity shifted the practice of science to the highly specialized and impersonal activity that it is perceived as today. Ball traces the intellectual history of curiosity, from the Renaissance cabinets of curiosity to the Large Hadron Collider at CERN that harks back to a view of nature as holding secrets that must be teased out with experimental apparatuses. He shows how curiosity went from being seen as a vice in medieval Catholic Europe, to a shallow form of inquisitiveness that inspired learned societies like the London philosophical club, and then, in the latter half of the sixteenth century, got recast as a virtue. Changes in the notion of curiosity from vice to virtue, he argues, have gone hand in hand with the development of empirical methods in science.&#x201d; (<i>New York Review of Books</i>)</p><h2>Computing Before Computers</h2><p>Computing Before Computers offers a concise survey of computing technology prior to the development of the modern computer.

It helps students develop the insight required to use the tools of digital imaging to solve new problems.Digital image processing has experienced explosive growth over the past two decades. Public awareness has increased by way of video games, digital video special effects used in the entertainment industry, as well as articles in the mainstream press. However, the most significant impact of digital image processing in the 90s will be in the area of applications to real-world problems. To help readers keep pace, author Kenneth R.

He created much of his art in obscurity, and only after his death in 1965 did the magnitude of his labors and genius come to light. </p><p> His works teem in the thousands and take many forms-watercolors, oil paintings, drawings, block prints, figurines, pottery, and murals. He produced more than ten thousand pen-and-ink illustrations, as well as poems, stories, journals, and letters. </p><p> Bringing together more than 175 full-color images, including works never before shown to the public, this catalog places Anderson in the context of his peers in twentieth-century American art and portrays him both as a major artist and a renaissance man. </p><p> He was born in New Orleans in 1903, graduated from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and spent his life on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. He and his two brothers became artists under the guidance of their mother. Peter and Mac established Shearwater Pottery, and Walter created murals for the community of Ocean Springs. </p><p> Walter Anderson was absorbed by poetry, music, art history, and natural science. A loner, he found his identity in the wilderness of pine savannahs and barrier islands along the coast. It was this natural wild that most imbued his art. </p><p> To honor Anderson on his centennial, this representative sampling of his work reveals him as an eccentric genius who explored the profound order of creation and made spiritual excursions into the terra incognita of the mind and inner self. </p><p> The contributors to this volume include noted art historians and curators from the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the daughter of Walter Anderson, and research staff at the Walter Anderson Museum of Art. They write in praise and in assessment of Anderson's art, share insights into his mysteries and techniques, and raise public awareness of his significance. </p><p>Patricia Pinson is curator of the Walter Anderson Museum of Art in Ocean Springs, Mississippi.</p></p><p><p>In celebration of his centennial, an overview of the life and works of &#x201c;the South&#x2019;s greatest artist.&#x201d;</p>In celebration of his centennial, an overview of the life and works of &#34;the South&#39;s greatest artist.&#34;|In celebration of his centennial, an overview of the life and works of &#34;the South&#39;s greatest artist.&#34;</p><h2>Environmental Protection: What Everyone Needs to Know�</h2><p>Although climate change and pollution make near-daily appearances in the news, humans have not always recognized that the environment needs to be protected. Only after the publication of Rachel Carson's <em>Silent Spring</em> in 1962 did environmental protection became a political and social priority.<br><br> In <em>Environmental Protection: What Everyone Needs to Know�</em>, environmental lawyer Pamela Hill offers clear, engaging answers to some of the most pressing questions facing us today. She discusses the science behind current environmental issues, defining key terms such as ecosystems, pollutants, and endocrine disruptors. Hill explains why our environment needs protection, using examples from history and current events, from the Irish potato famine to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan. She also assesses the effectiveness of landmark laws and treaties, including the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Kyoto Protocol. <br><br>To what extent is it acceptable to rank human interests over ecological interests? And is it fair to ask developing countries to reduce emissions, even though they bear little responsibility for our current environmental problems? Hill identifies the greatest environmental threats we are facing today and suggests what we need to do as citizens, businesspeople, and lawmakers to protect the environment for each other and for future generations.<br></p><p><br><strong>Pamela Hill</strong>, an environmental lawyer, is former Deputy Regional Counsel at the United States Environmental Protection Agency's New England Regional Office. She is a lecturer in environmental law at Boston University School of Law.<br><br>"Pam Hill is one of the most talented and thoughtful environmental lawyers in the country. She is also a great communicator who is able to take complicated ideas and break them down for common understanding.

Written at an appropriate level of rigor -- with a strong pedagogical focus -- it limits depth of coverage and areas covered to topics of genuine use in computer science. It stresses both basic theory and applications -- providing students with a firm foundation for more advanced courses.<p> Discrete mathematics is an interesting course to teach and to study at the freshman and sophomore level for several reasons. Its content is mathematics, but most of its applications and more than half its students are from computer science. Thus careful motivation of topics and previews of applications are important and necessary strategies. Moreover, there are a number of substantive and diverse topics covered in the course, so a text must proceed clearly and carefully, emphasizing key ideas with suitable pedagogy. In addition, the student is often expected to develop an important new skill: the ability to write a mathematical proof. This skill is excellent training for writing good computer programs. </p> <p> This text can be used by students in mathematics as an introduction to the fundamental ideas of discrete mathematics, and a foundation for the development of more advanced mathematical concepts. If used in this way, the topics dealing with specific computer science applications can be ignored or selected independently as important examples. The text can also be used in a computer science or computer engineering curriculum to present the foundations of many basic computer-related concepts and provide a coherent development and common theme for these ideas. The instructor can easily develop a suitable course by referring to the chapter prerequisites which identify material needed by that chapter. </p> <p><b>Approach</b></p> <p> First, we have limited both the areas covered and the depth of coverage to what we deem prudent in a first course taught at the freshman and sophomore level. We have identified a set of topics that we feel are of genuine use in computer science and elsewhere and that can be presented in a logically coherent fashion. We have presented an introduction to these topics along with an indication of how they can be pursued in greater depth. This approach makes our text an excellent reference for upper-division courses. </p> <p> Second, the material has been organized and interrelated to minimize the mass of definitions and the abstraction of some of the theory. Relations and digraphs are treated as two aspects of the same fundamental mathematical idea, with a directed graph being a pictorial representation of a relation. This fundamental idea is then used as the basis of virtually all the concepts introduced in the book, including functions, partial orders, graphs, and mathematical structures. Whenever possible, each new idea introduced in the text uses previously encountered material and, in turn, is developed in such a way that it simplifies the more complex ideas that follow. </p> <p><b>What Is New in the Fifth Edition</b></p> <p> We continue to believe that this book works well in the classroom because of the unifying role played by the two key concepts: relations and digraphs. In this edition we have woven in a thread of coding in all its aspects, efficiency, effectiveness, and security. Two new sections, Other Mathematical Structures and Public Key Cryptology are the major components of this thread, but smaller related insertions begin in Chapter 1. The number of exercises for this edition has been increased by more than 25%. Whatever changes we have made, our objective has remained the same as in the first four editions: <i>to present the basic notions of discrete mathematics and some of its applications .in a clear and concise manner that will be understandable to the student.</i> </p> <ul> <li>A cryptology thread begins in Chapter 1 and presents the basic ideas of the field. The thread concludes in Public Key Cryptology. Included now is coding in all its aspects, efficiency, effectiveness, and security.</li> <li>A new section, Other Mathematical Structures, introduces the basic concepts of rings and fields, in particular <i>Zp</i>.</li> <li>More opportunities for students to build modeling skills are provided. Whether seen as modeling, abstraction, pattern recognition, or problem solving, the ability to see the mathematical bones of a problem is a critical factor for success in higher-level mathematics courses.</li> <li>Understanding proofs and writing simple proofs are important course goals. More occasions for students to read, analyze, complete, and produce proofs are presented throughout the text, not just in the sections that introduce formal proofs.</li> <li>More applications are included. Among these are relational databases, check digits, a variety of ciphers, and weighted voting systems.</li> <li>New exercises have been added to each chapter. Greater emphasis has been placed on multiple representations of concepts. There are approximately 400 more exercises than in the fourth edition.</li> <li>A brief historical commentary opens each chapter and introduces some of the major contributors to that chapter's topics.</li> <li>Isomorphism is presented in more contexts than before throughout the book.</li> <li>Additional student experiments have been developed on weighted voting systems, Petri nets, and Catalan numbers. Experiments have been integrated into appropriate chapters and others are gathered in Appendix B. These assignments provide opportunities for exploration and discovery, as well as for writing, and are designed for collaborative work.</li> <li>This edition continues to weave the discussion of proofs and proof techniques throughout the book with comments on most proofs, exercises related to the mechanics of proving statements, and Tips for Proofs sections. Many of the new exercises provide more practice in building proof-reading and proof-writing skills.</li> <li>Each chapter now has a set of review questions. These are mainly conceptual in nature and help students identify the "big" ideas of the chapter.</li> <li>A glossary for quick reference is now included.</li> <li>The index contains approximately 100 new entries related to both new concepts and to new examples for material in previous editions.</li> </ul> <p><b>Exercises</b></p> <p> The exercises form an integral part of the book. Many are computational in nature, whereas others are of a theoretical type. Many of the latter and the experiments, to be further described below, require verbal solutions. Exercises to help develop proof-writing skills ask the student to analyze proofs, amplify arguments, or complete partial proofs. Guidance and practice in recognizing key elements and patterns have been extended in many new exercises. Answers to all odd-numbered exercises, review questions, and self-test items appear in the back of the book. Solutions to all exercises appear in the <b>Instructor's Solutions Manual,</b> which is available (to instructors only) gratis from the publisher. The Instructor's Solutions Manual also includes notes on the pedagogical ideas underlying each chapter, goals and grading guidelines for the experiments, and a test bank. </p> <p><b>Experiments</b></p> <p> Chapters 1 through 10 each end with a student experiment. These provide opportunities for discovery and exploration, or a more in-depth look at topics discussed in the text. They are designed as extended-time, out-of-class experiences and are suitable for group work. Each experiment requires significantly more writing than section exercises do. Some additional experiments are to be found in Appendix B. Content, prerequisites, and goals for each experiment are given in the Instructor's Solutions Manual. </p> <p><b>End-of-Chapter Material</b></p> <p> Each chapter contains Tips for Proofs, a summary of Key Ideas for Review, a set of Coding Exercises, an Experiment, a set of conceptual Review Questions, and a Self-Test covering the chapter's material. </p> <p><b>Organization</b></p> <p> Chapter 1 contains material that is fundamental to the course. This includes sets, subsets, and their operations; sequences; properties of the integers, including base n representations; matrices; and mathematical structures. A goal of this chapter is to help students develop skills in identifying patterns on many levels. Chapter 2 covers logic and related material, including methods of proof and mathematical induction. Although the discussion of proof is based on this chapter, the commentary on proofs continues throughout the book. Chapter 3, on counting, deals with permutations, combinations, the pigeonhole principle, elements of probability, and recurrence relations. </p> <p> Chapter 4 presents basic types and properties of relations, along with their representation as directed graphs. Connections with matrices and other data structures are also explored in this chapter. Chapter 5 deals with the notion of a function and gives important examples of functions, including functions of special interest in computer science. An introduction to the growth of functions is developed. Chapter 6 covers partially ordered sets, including lattices and Boolean algebras. A symbolic version for finding a Boolean function for a Boolean expression joins the pictorial Kamaugh method. Chapter 7 introduces directed and undirected trees along with applications of these ideas. Elementary graph theory with applications to transport networks and matching problems is the focus of Chapter 8. </p> <p> In Chapter 9 we return to mathematical structures and present the basic ideas of semigroups, groups, rings, and fields. By building on work in previous chapters, only a few new concepts are needed. Chapter 10 is devoted to finite-state machines. It complements and makes effective use of ideas developed in previous chapters. Chapter 11 finishes our discussion of coding for error detecting and correction and for security purposes. Appendix A discusses algorithms and pseudocode. The simplified pseudocode presented here is used in some text examples and exercises; these may be omitted without loss of continuity. Appendix B gives some additional experiments dealing with extensions or previews of topics in various parts of the course. </p></p><h2>Earthborn (Homecoming, Volume 5)</h2><p>In the epic conclusion of the Homecoming Saga, when the children of Harmony return to Earth, they find a much-altered world in which two intelligent races challenge the humans, while Shedemi and the Oversoul set out to find the Keeper of Earth.</p><p>Orson Scott Card is the author of the novels <i>Ender's Game</i>, <i>Ender's Shadow</i>, and <i>Speaker for the Dead</i>. <i>Ender&#x2019;s Game</i> and <i>Speaker for the Dead</i> both won Hugo and Nebula Awards, making Card the only author to win these two top prizes in consecutive years.

He remembered little from that time. One memory was of his father, Akmaro, carrying him up a high tower, and then handing him to another man there, who dangled him over the parapet until he screamed in fear. The man who held him laughed until Father reached out and took Akma from him and held him close. Later Mother told Akma that the man who tormented him on the tower was the king in the land of Nafai, a man named Nuak. "He was a very bad man," said Mother, "but the people didn't seem to mind as long as he was a good king. But when the Elemaki came and conquered the land of Nafai, the people of Nuak hated him so much they burned him to death." Ever after she told him that story, Akma's memory changed, and when he dreamed of the laughing man holding him over the edge of the tower, he pictured the man covered with flames until the whole tower was burning, and instead of Father reaching out to rescue his little boy, Akmaro jumped down, falling and falling and falling, and Akma didn't know what to do, to stay on the tower and burn, or jump into the abyss after his father. From that dream he awoke screaming in terror.</p><p>Another memory was of his Father rushing into the house in the middle of the day, as Mother supervised two digger women in preparing a feast for that night. The look on Akmaro's face was terrible, and though he whispered to her and Akma had no idea what he was saying, he knew that it was very bad and it made Akma afraid. Father rushed from the house right away, and Mother at once had the diggers stop their work on the feast and start gathering supplies for a journey. Only a few minutes later, four human men with swords came to the door and demanded to see the traitor Akmaro. Mother pretended that Father was in the back of the house and tried to block them from coming in. The biggest man knocked her down and held a sword across her throat while the others ran to search the house for Akmaro. Little Akma was outraged and ran at the man who was threatening Mother. The man laughed at him when Akma cut himself on one of the stones of his sword, but Mother didn't laugh. She said, "Why are you laughing? This little boy had the courage to attack a man with a sword, while you only have enough courage to attack an unarmed woman." The man was angry then, but when the others returned without finding Father, they all went away.</p><p>There was food, too. Akma was sure there had once been plenty of food, well-prepared by digger slaves. But now, in his hunger, he couldn't remember it. He couldn't remember ever being full. Here in the maize fields under the hot sun he couldn't remember a time without thirst, without a weary ache in his arms, in his back, in his legs, and throbbing behind his eyes. He wanted to cry, but he knew that this would shame his family. He wanted to scream at the digger taskmaster that he needed to drink and rest and eat and it was stupid for him to keep them working without food because it would wear out more people like old Tiwiak who dropped dead yesterday, dead just like that, keeled over into the maize and never so much as breathed out a good-bye to his wife and even then she kept still, said nothing as she knelt weeping silently over his body, but the taskmaster beat her anyway for stopping work, and it was her own <i>husband.</i></p><p>Akma hated nothing in the world the way he hated diggers. His parents had been wrong to keep diggers as servants back in the land of Nafai. The diggers should all have been killed before they ever came near to a real person. Father could talk all he wanted about how the diggers were only getting even for the long, cruel overlordship of Nuak. He could whisper late in the night about how the Keeper of Earth didn't want earth people and sky people and middle people to be enemies. Akma knew the truth. There would be no safety in the world until all the diggers were dead.</p><p>When the diggers came, Father refused to let any of his people fight. "You didn't follow me into the wilderness in order to become killers, did you?" he asked them. "The Keeper wants no killing of his children."</p><p>The only protest that Akma heard was Mother's whisper: <i>"Her</i> children." As if it mattered whether the Keeper had a plow or a pot between its legs. All that Akma knew was that the Keeper was a poor excuse for a god if it couldn't keep its worshippers from being enslaved by filthy bestial stupid cruel diggers.</p><p>But Akma said nothing about these thoughts, because the one time he did, Father grew silent and wouldn't speak to him for the rest of the night. That was unbearable. The silence during the days was bad enough. To have Father shut him out at night was the worst thing in the world. So Akma kept his hate for the diggers to himself, as well as his contempt for the Keeper, and at night he spoke in the barest whisper to his mother and father, and drank in their whispered words as if they were pure cold water from a mountain stream.</p><p>And then one day a new boy appeared in the village. He wasn't thin and sunbrowned like all the others, and his clothing was fine, bright-colored, and un-patched. His hair was clean and long, and the wind caught and tossed it when he stood on the brow of the low hill in the midst of the commons. After all that Father and Mother had said about the Keeper of Earth, Akma was still unprepared for this vision of a god, and he stopped working just to behold the sight.</p><p>The taskmaster shouted at Akma, but he didn't hear. All sound had been swallowed up in this vision, all sensation except sight. Only when the shadow of the taskmaster loomed over him, his arm upraised to strike him with the length of the prod, did Akma notice, and then he flinched and cowered and, almost by reflex, cried out to the boy who had the image of god on his face, "Don't let him hit me!"</p><p>"Hold!" cried the boy. His voice rang out confident and strong as he strode down the hill, and, incredibly, the taskmaster immediately obeyed him.</p><p>Father was far from Akma, but Mother was near enough to whisper to Akma's little sister Luet, and Luet took a few steps closer to Akma so she could call softly to him. "He's the son of Father's enemy," she said.</p><p>Akma heard her, and immediately became wary. But the beauty of the older boy did not diminish as he approached.</p><p>"What did she say to you?" asked the boy, his voice kind, his face smiling.</p><p>"That your father is my father's enemy."</p><p>"Ah, yes. But not by <i>my</i> father's choice," he said.</p><p>That gave Akma pause. No one had ever bothered to explain to the seven-year-old boy how his father had come to have so many enemies. It had never occurred to Akma that it might be his father's fault. But he was suspicious: How could he believe the son of his father's enemy? And yet . . . "You stopped the taskmaster from hitting me," said Akma.</p><p>The boy looked at the taskmaster, whose face was inscrutable. "From now on," he said, "you are not to punish this one or his sister without my consent. My father says."</p><p>The taskmaster bowed his head. But Akma thought he didn't look happy about taking orders like this from a human boy.</p><p>"My father is Pabulog," said the boy, "and my name is Didul."</p><p>"I'm Akma. My father is Akmaro."</p><p>"Ro-Akma? Akma the <i>teacher</i>?" Didul smiled. "What does <i>ro</i> have to teach, that he didn't learn from <i>og</i>?"</p><p>Akma wasn't sure what <i>og</i> meant.</p><p>Didul seemed to know why he was confused. "<i>Og</i> is the daykeeper, the chief of the priests. After the <i>ak</i>, the king, no one is wiser than <i>og</i>."</p><p><i>"King</i> just means you have the power to kill anybody you don't like, unless they have an army, like the Elemaki." Akma had heard his father say this many times.</p><p>"And yet now my father rules over the Elemaki of this land," said Didul. "While Nuak is dead. They burned him up, you know."</p><p>"Did you see it?" asked Akma.</p><p>"Walk with me. You're done with work for today." Didul looked at the taskmaster. The digger, drawn up to his full height, was barely the same size as Didul; when Didul grew to manhood, he would tower over the digger like a mountain over a hill. But in the case of Didul and the taskmaster, height had nothing to do with their silent confrontation. The digger wilted under his gaze.</p><p>Akma was in awe. As Didul took his hand and led him away, Akma asked him, "How do you do it?"</p><p>"Do what?" asked Didul.</p><p>"Make the taskmaster look so . . ."</p><p>"So useless?" asked Didul. "So helpless and stupid and low?"</p><p>Did the humans who were friends of the diggers hate them, too?</p><p>"It's simple," said Didul. "He knows that if he doesn't obey me, I'll tell my father and he'll lose his easy job here and go back to working on fortifications and tunnels, or going out on raids. And if he ever raised a hand against me, then of course my father would have him torn apart."</p><p>It gave Akma great satisfaction to imagine the taskmaster--all the taskmasters--being torn apart.</p><p>"I saw them burn Nuak, yes. He was king, of course, so he led our soldiers in war. But he'd gotten old and soft and stupid and fearful. Everybody knew it. Father tried to compensate for it, but <i>og</i> can only do so much when <i>ak</i> is weak. One of the great soldiers, Teonig, vowed to kill him so a real king could be put in his place--probably his second son, Ilihi--but you don't know any of these people, do you? You must have been--what, three years old? How old are you now?"</p><p>"Seven."</p><p>"Three, then, when your father committed treason and ran away like a coward into the wilderness and started plotting and conspiring against the pure human Nafari, trying to get humans and diggers and skymeat to live together as <i>equals</i>."</p><p>Akma said nothing. That <i>was</i> what his father taught. But he had never thought of it as treason against the purely human kingdom where Akma had been born.</p><p>"So what did you know? I bet you don't even remember being in court, do you? But you were there. I saw you, holding your father's hand. He presented you to the king."</p><p>Akma shook his head. "I don't remember."</p><p>"It was family day. We were all there. But you were just little. I remember you, though, because you weren't shy or scared or anything. Bold as you please. The king commented on it. 'This one's going to be a great man, if he's already so brave.' My father remembered. That's why he sent me to look for you."</p><p>Akma felt a thrill of pleasure flutter inside his chest. Pabulog had sent his son to seek him out, because he had been brave as a baby. He remembered attacking the soldier who was threatening his mother. Until this moment, he had never thought of himself as brave, but now he saw that it was true.</p><p>"Anyway, Nuak was at the point of being murdered by Teonig. They say that Teonig kept demanding that Nuak fight him. But Nuak kept answering, 'I'm the king! I don't have to fight you!' And Teonig kept shouting, 'Don't make me shame you by killing you like a dog.' Nuak fled up to the top of the tower and Teonig was on the point of killing him when the king looked out to the border of the Elemaki country and saw the hugest army of diggers you ever saw, flooding like a storm onto the land. So Teonig let him live, so the king could lead the defense. But instead of a defense, Nuak ordered his army to run so they wouldn't be destroyed. It was cowardly and shameful, and men like Teonig didn't obey him."</p><p>"But your father did," said Akma.</p><p>"My father had to follow the king. It's what the priests do," said Didul. "The king commanded the soldiers to leave their wives and children behind, but Father wouldn't do it, or at least anyway he took me. Carried me on his back and kept up with the others, even though I wasn't all that little and he isn't all that young. So that's why I was there when the soldiers realized that their wives and children were probably being slaughtered back in the city. So they stripped old Nuak and staked him down and held burning sticks against his skin so he screamed and screamed." Didul smiled. "You wouldn't believe how he screamed, the old sausage."</p><p>It sounded awful even to imagine it. It was frightening that Didul, who could remember having actually seen it, could be so complacent about it.</p><p>"Of course, along about then Father realized that the talk was turning to who else they ought to burn, and the priests would be an obvious target, so Father said a few quiet words in the priest-language and he led us to safety."</p><p>"Why didn't you go back to the city? Was it destroyed?"</p><p>"No, but Father says the people there weren't worthy to have true priests who knew the secret language and the calendar and everything. You know. Reading and writing."</p><p>Akma was puzzled. "Doesn't everybody learn how to read and write?"</p><p>Didul suddenly looked angry. "That's the most terrible thing your father did. Teaching everybody to read and write. All the people who believed his lies and sneaked out of the city to join him, even if they were just <i>peasants</i> which they mostly were, even if they were <i>turkey-herds.</i> Everybody. He took solemn vows, you know. When he was made a priest. Your father took those vows, never to reveal the secrets of the priesthood to anybody. And then he taught <i>everybody</i>."</p><p>"Father says all the people should be priests."</p><p>"People? Is that what he says?" Didul laughed. "Not just people, Akma. It isn't just <i>people</i> that he was going to teach to read."</p><p>Akma imagined his father trying to teach the taskmaster to read. He tried to picture one of the diggers bowed over a book, trying to hold a stylus and make the marks in the wax of the tablets. It made him shudder.</p><p>"Hungry?" asked Didul.</p><p>Akma nodded.</p><p>"Come eat with me and my brothers." Didul led him into the shade of a copse behind the hill of the commons.</p><p>Akma knew the place--until the diggers came and enslaved them, it was the place where Mother used to gather the children to teach them and play quiet games with them while Father taught the adults at the hill. It gave him a strange feeling to see a large basket of fruit and cakes and a cask of wine there, with diggers serving the food to three humans. Diggers didn't belong in that place where his mother had led the children in play.</p><p>But the humans did. Or rather, they would belong wherever they were. One was little, barely as old as Akma. The other two were both older and larger than Didul--men, really, not boys. One of the older ones looked much like Didul, only not as beautiful. The eyes were perhaps too close together, the chin just a bit too pronounced. Didul's image, but distorted, inferior, unfinished.</p><p>The other man-sized boy was as unlike Didul as could be imagined. Where Didul was graceful, this boy was strong; where Didul's face looked open and light, this one looked brooding and private and dark. His body was so powerful-looking that Akma marveled that he could pick up any of the fruit without crushing it.</p><p>Didul obviously saw which of his brothers it was that had drawn Akma's attention. "Oh, yes. Everybody looks at him like that. Pabul, my brother. He leads armies of diggers. He's killed with his bare hands."</p><p>Hearing his words, Pabul looked up and glowered at Didul.</p><p>"Pabul doesn't like it when I tell about that. But I saw him once take a full-grown digger soldier and break his neck, just like a rotten dry branch. Snap. The beast peed all over everything."</p><p>Pabul shook his head and went back to eating.</p><p>"Have some food," said Didul. "Sit down, join us. Brothers, this is Akma, the son of the traitor."</p><p>The older brother who looked like Didul spat.</p><p>"Don't be rude, Udad," said Didul. "Tell him not to be rude, Pabul."</p><p>"...</p></p><h2>The Picture of Dorian Gray</h2><p>Canterbury Classics gives a new look to this controversial classic!<br><br><i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is a familiar story of greed, sin, and arrogance. A young man, infatuated with his own handsomeness and youth as depicted in a perfect portrait, makes a bargain he will come to regret. No one can save him from his appetite for pleasure and his awful fate--not the man who idolizes him, not the woman who loves him, and not even himself!<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>Published in 1890, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is Oscar Wilde&#x2019;s only novel. At first the subject of intense controversy, it has endured as a classic for years. This Canterbury Classics edition includes the beloved story as well as a special heat-burnished cover, foil stamping, and designed endpapers in an easy-to-carry package.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>A cautionary tale of innocence sacrificed for the sake of vice, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is a classic whose lessons are still relevant today. <br> <br>&nbsp;<br><br>About the Word Cloud Classics series:<br><br>Classic works of literature with a clean, modern aesthetic! Perfect for both old and new literature fans, the Word Cloud&nbsp;Classics series from Canterbury Classics provides a chic and inexpensive introduction to timeless tales. With a higher production value, including heat burnished covers and foil stamping, these eye-catching, easy-to-hold editions are the perfect gift for students and fans of literature everywhere.</p><p>A lush, cautionary tale of a life of vileness and deception or a loving portrait of the aesthetic impulse run rampant? Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>Oscar Wilde's only published full length novel, is the story of a man who sells his soul for eternal youth. In exchange, what does he give up and what does he gain? This novel, by Wilde is a wonderful soul-searching example of the cost of paradise, and the price of a wish. <p>Read by actor, comedian, novelist, journalist, screenwriter Stephen Fry, Dorian Gray's dilemma comes alive. He has also acted in a variety of films including A Fish Called Wanda, Peter's Friends, and The Wind in the Willows.</p></p><h2>Kids Deserve It!: Pushing Boundaries and Challenging Conventional Thinking</h2><p>What if learning was exciting?

Growing up in the conservative South, I never considered that question. I didn&#x2019;t understand anything of women&#x2019;s rights except the caricatures I saw on the news during attempts to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. But&nbsp;&nbsp; I was one of three daughters, no sons, born to a Christian dad who valued his girls well. Though I experienced my fair share of struggles growing up, female oppression in a patriarchal society did not seem to be one of them. As I got older and watched the news with a more critical eye, a different view of women came into my line of sight. There were countries where women couldn&#x2019;t vote? There were cultures that would put victims of rape to death in honor killings?<br><br> Then I moved to Seattle, where women&#x2019;s rights and feminist issues are often center stage in local news and conversation. I couldn&#x2019;t hide from these issues anymore. Female mutilation, legal oppression, and culturally accepted rape were much bigger issues affecting many more women worldwide than I had ever understood. And domestic abuse, the blaming of sexual abuse survivors, and discrimination in the workforce occurred closer to home. My experience of being valued as a female by the men in my life was not the norm worldwide, but I also came to realize it wasn&#x2019;t the norm in the conservative South either. I was bombarded by women&#x2019;s issues. As a believer in Jesus since childhood and one who loved and valued the Bible, I was barraged with criticism of the Scripture around women&#x2019;s issues as well. Does the Bible address oppression of women in helpful ways? Or does it only perpetuate such oppression among its followers? In a world that is quite often very bad for women, does the Bible help or does it make it worse?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>HARMFUL WORLDWIDE PRACTICES</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> National Public Radio recently highlighted a disturbing practice in western Nepal in which young women are banished to outdoor sheds when they are on their periods.1 The families interviewed believe that the girls could cause illnesses among the family&#x2019;s elderly if they touch them while menstruating. The humiliation and stigma those girls endure is worth public outcry.<br><br> Hinduism is the primary religion (81 percent) in Nepal.2 Although Judaism and Christianity have made small inroads into the country, this practice of barring young menstruating women from their homes does not seem to have a direct relationship to Old Testament Law. Yet I can&#x2019;t help but think of similar instructions in the Law (see Leviticus 15:19&#x2013;33) when I hear of the Nepali practice. I know from Scripture that despite the similarities, the Nepali practice is a perversion of God&#x2019;s intent in the Law. The Nepali tradition attributes to girls on their periods something Old Testament Law never does, it does so without the Law&#x2019;s corresponding instruction to men, and it perpetuates a practice&nbsp;&nbsp; that Jesus said two thousand years ago was brought to completion through Him. (We will work this out in greater detail in chapters 6 and 7.)<br><br> But the comparison puts a question to us, one that many women ask themselves: Is the Bible good for women? How can a book that includes instructions on where a woman can sleep or sit when menstruating be trusted by women today when similar modern practices like that of the Nepalese are clearly harmful for women?<br><br> We have not always been suspicious about the Bible&#x2019;s take on women&#x2019;s issues. For long periods in history, people viewed the Bible and Christianity as powers that lifted the downtrodden and demoralized to new places of respect. During the twentieth century, the first wave of feminism gave voice to women whom society had long marginalized. In 1920, women finally won the right to vote in the United States, due in large part to the efforts of Christians. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union led this movement, seeking to apply biblical principles of social justice to larger society.3 Based in part on their understanding of Jesus and the Bible, men and women of faith fought together for women to have the right to vote. This first wave of feminism resulted in women&#x2019;s right to vote and inherit land, along with subsequent benefits to both women and children as women gained a voice in legislation.<br><br> But as the century wore on, there came a fork in the road in which orthodox Christianity seemed to go in one direction concerning the rights of women, and second-wave feminism (which focused on birth control, abortion rights, and equal pay) in another. In the last few years, many pro-women authors (for lack of a better name), even Christian ones, have painted a picture of women in the Bible that is troubling, even referring to certain passages concerning women in the Bible as &#x201c;texts of terror.&#x201d;4 According to many books and popular blogs, the view in our current culture is that an orthodox understanding of the Bible is threatening and even downright harmful to women. The similarities between Old Testament Law having to do with women on their periods and the Nepali practice that results in shaming menstruating girls seem to only reinforce such a distrust of Scripture.<br><br> Other books have dissected the history of evangelical Christianity and the secular women&#x2019;s movement.5 Rather than looking at how we arrived at the twenty-first-century general mistrust of the Bible regarding women, I would like instead to simply challenge it by encouraging us to discover and use a Jesus-centered understanding of Scripture when reading the Bible. In turn, this gives us a Jesus-centered understanding of how the Bible speaks about women and to women in its pages. I believe this process will give us all a life-giving perspective of our gendered selves in God&#x2019;s kingdom. It will help us see the profound difference in the shame that fathers project onto menstruating Nepali daughters and the dignity God places on His.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>CHECK YOUR BAGGAGE FIRST</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Before we develop a Jesus-centered understanding of Scripture, let&#x2019;s examine any personal baggage we might bring to this study. What presuppositions and suspicions do you carry into a&nbsp;&nbsp; discussion of gender in the Bible? What can we agree on as a basic foundation to start the discussion? Secular or Christian, feminist or conservative, most everyone agrees that men and women are not exactly the same. The biological differences are obvious; the role culture takes in influencing other differences is debated. One thing is clear: the basic biological differences in XX and XY chromosomes play out both physically and mentally at some level in differences between the genders for 99 percent of humanity. *<br><br> Male and female are overlapping but distinct identifiers. Men and women have similarities as well as differences. In a Venn diagram comparing the two genders, an overlapping middle part exists between male and female. But here is where our baggage comes into play. The conversation around gender in the church often seems to involve two camps: one that loves the overlapping part of the Venn diagram of gender but feels threatened by any reference to distinctions, and one that loves the distinctions but has a narrow view of the overlap.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> * According to the Intersex Society of North America, www.isna.org/faq/frequency, some form of biological disorder concerning gender affects approximately 1 percent of the human population. Although biological abnormalities are real, we are focusing here on the predominant statistical norms of gender.<br> &nbsp;<br> How do you feel about the disparate nature of gender? Do you prefer to focus on the overlapping parts? Do you feel threatened by those who emphasize the distinctions? Or perhaps you find the distinctions more comfortable and feel discomfort with those who emphasize the overlap. It is helpful to acknowledge your preconceptions as you start this study.<br><br> Personally, I see a big fat middle part of overlap in my mental Venn diagram of gender as presented in Scripture. Men and women share much responsibility and authority in God&#x2019;s kingdom. But I also love and value the distinct elements of manhood and womanhood. I see value in both sides of the debate, and I have baggage from both sides. We have much to work through here&#x2014;both you as the book&#x2019;s reader and I as its author!<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>CHECK YOUR MOTIVE</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Once you have checked your baggage, it is also helpful to acknowledge your motive for reading this book. Maybe, for instance, you believe in Jesus and are curious to understand what the Bible says on women&#x2019;s issues. Because you love Jesus, you want to understand better the Scriptures that speak of Him. Or maybe you don&#x2019;t believe in Jesus and want to explore more about the Bible as you decide about Him. How can He be good in general if He is not good for women, right?<br><br> There is a third type of reader as well. You might generally believe in Jesus but are not sure what you believe about the Bible. Gandhi famously said that he liked what he knew of Christ but not what he knew of Christians. In this book, I will deal with a similar but different issue. What happens when people like what they know of Christ but not what they know of the Bible, particularly when it comes to women&#x2019;s issues? This certainly presents a problem for someone wanting to know more about Christ. How can we know Jesus in truth without confidence in the primary historical document that speaks of Him?<br><br> Despite having come to Christ at a young age, I deeply wrestled with the goodness and trustworthiness of the Bible. I knew that factual evidence existed for some of its supernatural claims. For instance, as a math teacher who appreciates science, I was intrigued that Isaiah spoke of God sitting enthroned &#x201c;above the circle of the earth&#x201d; (Isaiah 40:22) some two thousand years before Christopher Columbus first theorized that the earth was round. I found it noteworthy that the Old Testament lawgiver exhibited an understanding of how infectious diseases are transmitted (by sharing dirty items and touching without washing; see Leviticus 15), one that the medical community didn&#x2019;t discover or accept until the late 1800s. There is evidence throughout Scripture of an intelligent being with knowledge above and over mankind&#x2019;s directing the writing of Scripture. Yet I still could not logically argue my way into belief in the trustworthiness of Scripture. In the end I still had to take a step of faith that the Bible is what it says it is.<br><br> What exactly does the Bible claim for itself? Its claims are frankly audacious:<br> � Its instructions are a lamp to guide our feet along a rocky path (see Psalm 119:105).<br> � No author wrote on his own, but each was moved along by the Holy Spirit (see 2 Peter 1:20&#x2013;21).<br> � All Scripture is inspired, or &#x201c;breathed out,&#x201d; by God (2 Timothy 3:16&#x2013;17).<br><br>Yet big issues can cause our confidence in Scripture&#x2019;s claims about itself to break down.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>THE CHALLENGE</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> The first issue that can break our confidence in Scripture is that the Bible is big and complicated. It includes prophecies, laws, and history. Large sections teach how to worship God, and other sections give wise advice for living. Scripture details the development of humanity from creation until the very last days that we will live on earth as we know it. The Bible tells a long, winding story that crisscrosses itself again and again. It repeats themes through multiple books, treats the same theme from multiple angles, and teaches truths both systematically and allegorically. Many view it like a calculus textbook from which they quickly turn away because they believe that it is impossible to understand. Both new and seasoned Christians face the temptation to give up trying to understand Scripture or reconcile problem passages.<br><br> The second issue is this: if we encounter some subset of Bible truth about women, particularly troubling passages in the Law, without understanding the larger narrative of Scripture, what conclusion could we reach except that the Bible is as bad for women as the Nepali tradition is for Nepali daughters? Passages such as the Law&#x2019;s command to a rapist to marry his victim (see Deuteronomy 22:28&#x2013;29) or the decree to stone a woman who is not a virgin at marriage (see verses 20&#x2013;21) can, at face value, seem irreconcilable with a good God. In our calculus book example, this is the same as flipping only to a complicated problem in the middle of the book without understanding how the previous chapters set up the problem or how the following chapters resolve it. We slam the book shut, believing calculus to be impractical and worthless, maybe even harmful.<br><br> Understanding the Bible does not have to be this way. The Bible does not give us problems that it does not also teach us how to solve. We have help to understand it. Who is this help? The psalmist prayed that God Himself would aid him in understanding Scripture: &#x201c;Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law&#x201d; (Psalm 119:18). His prayer reveals that although we understand God through Scripture, we also understand Scripture through God. If we believe the psalmist, there is something wonderful to be seen when we stay engaged in the struggle to understand.<br><br> If you are not confident in either Jesus or the Bible, it may feel unsettling to engage God in prayer to understand Scripture. Nevertheless, doing so is helpful at the start of this study: God, open our eyes to see wonderful things in and through the Bible, even for those of us who are not yet sure what we believe about You or Your Scripture.<br><br> If you come to this study questioning the goodness and trustworthiness of the Bible, I encourage you to stay engaged in the struggle.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>GOD THE AUTHOR</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> As we begin this journey to understand the Bible and women, we should think for a moment about the One who claims to be its Author. You might not be ready to accept that there is a God and He is the author of the Bible, but it is intriguing to consider the implications if there is and if He is. For those who believe the Genesis story of creation, the God who created the world and hung the stars in the sky is a logical mathematician. He was the first Physicist and is still the ultimate Engineer. Yet this same God colored His ordered world with beautiful hues. The God revealed in the Bible is the greatest Artist and the most poetic Author. He is both left-brained and right-brained, and His written Word to us reflects both aspects of His character. The Bible is both logical and artistic. It lays a logical framework, but it fleshes out that framework with metaphor and allusion.<br><br> God primarily tells us a story through the Bible, one in which womanhood is a major theme and driving force in the narrative. It&#x2019;s been said that the Bible begins with a divorce (God&#x2019;s separation from His people after the fall of man) and ends with a marriage (the marriage supper of the Lamb in Revelation), and everything in between is the story of God wooing back His bride. This is a helpful way of understanding God&#x2019;s story to us. But it&#x2019;s important to remember that God actually began His story wi...</p><h2>The Non-Designer&#39;s InDesign Book: Essential Design Techniques for Print Projects</h2><p><p>Many designers and photographers own the entire suite of Adobe&#x2019;s creative products, but they manage to learn only one or two of the applications really well.

He condemns the politics and thought of the age, brings comfort to the &#x201c;insulted and injured,&#x201d; and gains the love of two women suggestive of the biblical Mary and Martha. But there is a sinister side of him: in his vest he carries a vial of prussic acid...<br><br> The novel creates a powerful sense of Nagel's stream of thought, as he increasingly withdraws into the torture chamber of his own subconscious psyche.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics.</p><p>Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements.</p></p><p>John Holland's <i>Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems</i> is one of the classics in the field of complex adaptive systems. Holland is known as the father of genetic algorithms and classifier systems and in this tome he describes the theory behind these algorithms. Drawing on ideas from the fields of biology and economics, he shows how computer programs can evolve. The book contains mathematical proofs that are accessible only to those with strong backgrounds in engineering or science.John H.

In the interests of effective political action, are we right to accept acts of deceit, exploitation or force which we would regard as unacceptable in private relations with individuals? What means can be properly adopted in the promotion of great public causes? The problem of &#39;dirty hands&#39; in politics was posed most strikingly by Machiavelli. It has re-emerged this century in a pressing and, to some extent, a new form, in connection with the two World Wars and more recently the Vietnam War, where the political decisions and the destruction, and risks of destruction, have been of a scale and character not previously experienced. The contributors, including Bernard Williams, Thomas Nagel, T. M. Scanlon, and Ronald Dworkin, examine the background to this problem in moral and political theory.</p><p>Collection of essays by well-known British and American philosophers on the moral principles by which public policies and political decisions should be judged: does effective political action necessarily involve and justify actions which the individual would regard as unacceptable in &#34;private&#34; morality?Stuart Hampshire was Bonsall Professor of Philosophy at Stanford University.</p><h2>Spirituality In Patient Care: Why How When &amp; What</h2><p><p>This book is intended as a guide for practicing physicians, medical students, and residents to help identify and address the spiritual needs of patients.

In the past forty years, scientists have discovered that our sleep (or lack of it) can affect nearly every aspect of our waking lives. Poor sleep could be a sign of a disease, the result of a vitamin or iron deficiency, or the cause of numerous other problems, both sleeping and waking. Yet many people, even medical personnel, are unaware of the dangers of poor sleep. Enter Dr. Meir Kryger, a world authority on the science of sleep, with a comprehensive guide to the mysteries of slumber that combines detailed case studies, helpful tables, illustrations, and pragmatic advice.<br> &nbsp;<br> Everyone needs a good night&#x2019;s sleep, and many of us will experience some difficulty sleeping or staying awake over the course of our lifetimes (or know someone who does). Kryger&#x2019;s comprehensive text is a much-needed resource for insomniacs; for those who snore, can&#x2019;t stay awake, or experience disturbing dreams; and for the simply curious. Uniquely wide ranging, <i>The Mystery of Sleep</i> is more than a handbook; it is a guide to the world of sleep and the mysterious disorders that affect it.<br></p><p><b>Meir Kryger, M.D.</b>, is a professor in the Yale School of Medicine and chief editor of the most widely used sleep medicine textbook, <i>Principles and Practice of Sleep Medicine.</i> He is recognized as a global authority on sleep and has appeared on <i>The Dr. Oz Show,</i> CNN, ABC news, and BBC Radio 5."Kryger, a professor at Yale Medical School, is a leader in the field of sleep medicine, and has treated more than thirty thousand patients with sleep problems during a career that spans four decades. He draws on this voluminous clinical experience in his book, which is an authoritative and accessible survey of what is known, what is believed, and what is still obscure about normal patterns of sleep and the conditions that disrupt it."&#x2014;Jerome Groopman, <i>New Yorker</i><br>&#x201c;Ably marries science with a doctor&#x2019;s advice.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br>"This book introduces readers to the topic of sleep, raises awareness of the effects of sleep disorders on people&#x2019;s lives, and empowers people to use the tools in the book to recognize sleep problems and to seek help."&#x2014;Ermal Bojdani,<i> Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine</i><br>&#x201c;Dr. Kryger, winner of the National Sleep Foundation&#x2019;s 2014 Lifetime Achievement Award, beautifully describes the enigmatic nature of human sleep from birth through retirement.&nbsp; A must-read for all sleepers!&#x201d;&#x2014;Lauren Hale, Editor-in-Chief, <i>Sleep Health</i><br>&#x201c;This readable book fills an important gap in the popular literature about sleep.

Award-winning author Jonathan Edlow, M.D., shows the doctor as detective and the epidemiologist as elite sleuth in stories that are as gripping as the best thrillers.</p><p>In these stories a notorious stomach bug turns a suburban dinner party into a disaster that almost claims its host; a diminutive woman routinely eats more than her football-playing boyfriend but continually loses weight; a young executive is diagnosed with lung cancer, yet the tumors seem to wax and wane inexplicably. Written for the lay person who wishes to better grasp how doctors decipher the myriad clues and puzzling symptoms they often encounter, each story presents a very different case where doctors must work to find the accurate diagnosis before it is too late. Edlow uses his unique ability to relate complex medical concepts in a writing style that is clear, engaging and easily understandable. The resulting stories both entertain us and teach us much about medicine, its history and the subtle interactions among pathogens, humans, and the environment.</p></p><p><b>Jonathan A.

It examines Stallman's unique personality and how that personality has been at turns a driving force and a drawback in terms of the movement's overall success.<i>Free as in Freedom</i> examines one man's 20-year attempt to codify and communicate the ethics of 1970s era "hacking" culture in such a way that later generations might easily share and build upon the knowledge of their computing forebears. The book documents Stallman's personal evolution from teenage misfit to prescient adult hacker to political leader and examines how that evolution has shaped the free software movement. Like Alan Greenspan in the financial sector, Richard Stallman has assumed the role of tribal elder within the hacking community, a community that bills itself as anarchic and averse to central leadership or authority. How did this paradox come about? <i>Free as in Freedom</i> provides an answer. It also looks at how the latest twists and turns in the software marketplace have diminished Stallman's leadership role in some areas while augmenting it in others.Finally, <i>Free as in Freedom</i> examines both Stallman and the free software movement from historical viewpoint. Will future generations see Stallman as a genius or crackpot? The answer to that question depends partly on which side of the free software debate the reader currently stands and partly upon the reader's own outlook for the future. 100 years from now, when terms such as "computer," "operating system" and perhaps even "software" itself seem hopelessly quaint, will Richard Stallman's particular vision of freedom still resonate, or will it have taken its place alongside other utopian concepts on the 'ash-heap of history?'</p></p><p>I am the author of this book, and I welcome all feedback.

The book, reissued on its 25th anniversary as part of the Stanford Business Classics series, includes a new preface written by Jeffrey Pfeffer, which examines the legacy of this influential work in current research and its relationship to other theories.<br><br>The <i>External Control of Organizations</i> explores how external constraints affect organizations and provides insights for designing and managing organizations to mitigate these constraints. All organizations are dependent on the environment for their survival. As the authors contend, it is the fact of the organization� s dependence on the environment that makes the external constraint and control of organizational behavior both possible and almost inevitable.� Organizations can either try to change their environments through political means or form interorganizational relationships to control or absorb uncertainty. This seminal book established the resource dependence approach that has informed so many other important organization theories.<br><br></p><p>&#x201c;Two of the best minds in the business, Pfeffer and Salancik crafted this powerful argument that remains timely and timeless.

Weick,Rensis Likert Distinguished University Professor of Organizational Behavior and Psychology, University of Michigan Business School<br>&#x201c;Launching the resource dependence theory of organizations, this influential work was the first to recognize the power of the wider social-political environment as a force shaping organizational structure and behavior. Recognizing that all organizations must acquire resources from the environment as a condition of their survival, Pfeffer and Salancik demonstrate how resource dependence gives rise to power problems and, potentially, to political solutions.&#x201d; &#x2014;W.

Her book combines information from her studies of astronomy and ancient ceremonial sites with extensive knowledge of both Native American and New Age spiritual practices. The impressionistic, anecdotal style that makes this book quite readable is also, however, sometimes its weakness. Bryant makes statements such as the following about Judaculla Rock in North Carolina: "This was a diagram of a part of the heavens! I knew it with an intuitive "knowing" that rose from the deepest part of me...from my soul." While filled with genuinely thought-provoking information, this book also contains a number of passages like the above, in which little else besides the author's notions makes the connection between a legend or object and her starwalking theme. Bryant also includes passages from her spirit guide, Albion and a belief in channelling is required to take those passages as seriously as other parts of the book. If you are very open to New Age practices, intrigued by the spiritual significance of the stars and planets, or interested in Native American spiritual practices, Starwalking will provide you with a plethora of ideas and significant history. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>The Jungle Books (Penguin Leather Classic)</h2><p><p>Part of a beautiful collection of hardcover classics, designed by the award-winning Coralie Bickford-Smith.</p><p>The story of Mowgli<i>,</i> the man-cub who is brought up by wolves in the jungles of Central India, is one of the greatest literary myths ever created.

But this vital American promise has been broken. Christopher Newfield argues that the financial and political crises of public universities are not the result of economic downturns or of ultimately valuable restructuring, but of a conservative campaign to end public education&#x2019;s democratizing influence on American society. <i>Unmaking the Public University</i> is the story of how conservatives have maligned and restructured public universities, deceiving the public to serve their own ends. It is a deep and revealing analysis that is long overdue. </p><p> Newfield carefully describes how this campaign operated, using extensive research into public university archives. He launches the story with the expansive vision of an equitable and creative America that emerged from the post-war boom in college access, and traces the gradual emergence of the anti-egalitarian &#x201c;corporate university,&#x201d; practices that ranged from racial policies to research budgeting. Newfield shows that the culture wars have actually been an economic war that a conservative coalition in business, government, and academia have waged on that economically necessary but often independent group, the college-educated middle class. Newfield&#x2019;s research exposes the crucial fact that the culture wars have functioned as a kind of neutron bomb, one that pulverizes the social and culture claims of college grads while leaving their technical expertise untouched. <i>Unmaking the Public University</i> incisively sets the record straight, describing a forty-year economic war waged on the college-educated public, and awakening us to a vision of social development shared by scientists and humanists alike. </p></p><p>Christopher Newfield is Professor of English at the University of California, Santa Barbara.Newfield's argument is original, his evidence varied and rich, and his historical narrative coherent. He situates the university in its broadest social context, and shows that the 'culture wars,' far from being a sideshow, have in fact cleverly been fomented by conservatives to reshape the values of the university, the world-view of its graduates, and the economy which it significantly shapes and which shapes it. <br> --David L. Kirp, author of <i>Shakespeare, Einstein, and the Bottom Line: The Marketing of Higher Education</i><br><br>In a crowd of recent works dedicated to the changing university and its place in society, Newfield's rich, cogently argued and readable book stands out. This is that rare thing, truly critical history: a solidly researched book that is at once a fine example of the sort of scholarship that the American university still makes possible and a serious argument about the university.<br> --Anthony Grafton, author of <i>The Footnote: A Curious History</i><br><br>It is not every day that you get a meticulous analysis of higher education budgetary mechanisms within the same covers as reflections on Robert Pirsig's <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>. And the sheer generosity of spirit that underlies Newfield's rather depressing reflections is deeply attractive.<br> --Alan Ryan (<i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i> 2008-09-18)<br><br>It is not often that even a first-rate scholar and writer manages to delve so deeply into a core problem of his society and time as to come out with an understanding of it that is so complete, so profound--indeed revelatory--as to illuminate the public muddled mind and open the way to recovery. This is what Christopher Newfield has achieved in his book, <i>Unmaking the Public University</i>. The problem in focus is the decline of the American public university...Newfield's thesis is that this decline has been orchestrated by the American Right who, in the 1970s, got frightened by the democratizing influence higher public education was exerting on the American society. Conservative elites felt threatened by the post-World War II rise of a college-educated economic majority--a mass middle class--and started an assault against it. The Right did not dare to openly attack the economic position of the middle class. Instead, they waged culture wars against it.<br> --Emilia Ilieva (<i>Daily Nation</i> 2010-05-30)</p><h2>ETFs for the Long Run</h2><p><b>Praise for <i>ETFs For The Long Run</i></b> <p>"As the title of the book suggests, ETFs are going to be an increasingly important reality for a broad class of investors in coming years.

There are the deep pine and spruce forests, the grouse and the deer, and the hunter's gun. There is Magdalena, the beautiful mistress of the village priest, whose suicide unleashes her ghost to haunt the parish. There are also the loving grandparents with whom Thomas lives, who provide a balance of the not-quite-Dostoevskian devils that visit the villagers. In the end, Thomas is severed from his childhood and the Issa River, and leaves prepared for adventures beyond his valley.

By immersing himself in the calm simplicity of nature, Thoreau wanted to go on a spiritual journey and find independence and a greater sense of self. Thoreau has said: &#x2018;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.&#x2019;</p><p><b>Henry David Thoreau </b>(1817&#x2013;62) was an American writer and philosopher, born in Massachusetts.

Throughout his career Thoreau wrote on the subjects of natural history, philosophy, environmentalism and nature. He delivered lectures aimed at ending slavery and his philosophy surrounding civil disobedience had a profound impact on the actions of political figures such as Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi long after his death in 1862.&nbsp; <b>Judith John</b> (glossary) is a writer and editor specializing in literature and history.

It explains how words and phrases dovetail, how clauses pair up with other clauses, how sentences come together to create harmonious paragraphs. Since this is a book about the basics it starts with the fundamentals, explaining first the two types of Japanese sentence-"A is B" and "A does B." Then it proceeds to the problem of the modifier and the modified-a matter of "which is which." Wa and ga naturally get considerable play; after all, it is downright impossible to speak properly without them. There is also a discussion of linking nouns and noun phrases, not to speak of verbs and verb phrases. The book goes on to devote a whole chapter to common mistakes and troublesome usages. The final chapter attempts to pin down some particularly slippery locutions: such as toshite, imada ni, sore kara, whoppers like "Sentence A-te sae inakereba, Sentence B," and many more. <br><br>Any beginning or intermediate student, having spent a certain amount of time and energy studying this book, will be able to speak and read Japanese in a much more coherent fashion.</p><p>Preface <p>The purpose of this book is to provide helpful information about Japanese expressions and usages that facilitate the flow of ideas and thought in written and spoken Japanese. </p><p>During my thirty-year teaching career, I have seen a great variety of mistakes, many of which were the result of cultural differences or differences in the way that second-language learners and native speakers of Japanese conceptualize language. The book attempts to help students become aware of these differences in conceptualization and to provide them with the linguistic tools to overcome these differences, thereby allowing their ideas to flow more naturally. The book focuses on those grammatical items, idiomatic expressions, and set phrases that have proven to be the most problematic to my students. </p><p>The patterns are presented with examples, and tips are provided throughout the text to highlight particularly important points.

His masterful blend of classical and contemporary thinking about the use of language and the value of symbolic inducements for social cooperation illuminates fundamental rhetorical precepts and their implications for shaping human realities. The new chapter on publics theory complements the four chapters that introduce the broad themes and issues essential for a rhetorical approach to communication. The new chapter on narrative theory bridges the four chapters devoted to the content of rhetoric and the concluding chapters that emphasize symbolic processes by which humans induce social cooperation and constitute social reality. Throughout the text, Hauser skillfully underscores the power of language to present a particular reality. He explores the fundamental relationship between public discourse and judgment, helping students understand the core of rhetoric's civic function. Through relevant, current examples, he illustrates how knowledge and power shape our social and political practices and how both are formed through discourse.<p> Titles of related interest also available from Waveland Press: Foss, <i>Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice,</i> Fourth Edition (ISBN 9781577665861); Foss et al., <i>Contemporary Perspectives on Rhetoric,</i> 30th Anniversary Edition (ISBN 9781478615248); Foss et al., <i>Readings in Contemporary Rhetoric</i> (ISBN 9781577662068); Sillars-Gronbeck, <i>Communication Criticism: Rhetoric, Social Codes, Cultural Studies</i> (ISBN 9781577661719); and Smith, <i>Rhetoric and Human Consciousness: A History,</i> Third Edition (ISBN 9781577665878).</p></p><p></p><h2>Adventures in Singing</h2><p>This popular voice guide combines a thorough introduction to the singing process with an anthology of 60 songs.

This well-organized text integrates all of the techniques that jazz musicians practice into a comprehensive whole. It covers practice patterns and scales in all keys and tempos, transcribing solos of master improvisers, learning the jazz repertoire, and playing with other musicians. Applicable to any instrument-or a classroom of varied instruments-the material in this book will be beneficial to students and professionals at all levels of proficiency.</p><p>This book covers practice patterns and scales in all keys and tempos, transcribing solos of master improvisors, learning the jazz repertoire, and playing with other musicians. Students and professionals at any level of proficiency will find the material beneficial. The text may be applied to any instrument, or a classroom of varied instrumentation.Preface <p> It is gratifying that, since the publication of the first edition in 1989 and the second in 1995, many college educators, private instructors, and students of jazz have found Creative Jazz Improvisation to be a valuable aid in their musical growth. This text is a direct outgrowth of over twenty-one years of experiences teaching jazz improvisation at the college level, as well as my own personal quest to develop as a jazz artist. </p><p> I believe there is a direct parallel between life and art. The pursuit of understanding in any art form can teach us much about ourselves and serve as a catalyst for a lifetime of learning. My own musical perspectives have evolved since the second edition of this text was written, and much of this new information has been incorporated into the present volume. Therefore, I believe this edition to be much more than a minor reworking of the previous one. However, all of the same features that made Creative Jazz Improvisation a popular choice for classroom use are retained, including:</p><p>The philosophy that there are several paths to the same goal and that each student learns in his or her own unique way. An orientation in difficulty toward college-level and intermediate-to-advanced musicians. For students at the high-school or community college level or adult beginners, I strongly recommend the entry-level companion to this text, Creative Beginnings, which comes with a play-along compact disc. The division of the majority of chapters into sections devoted to jazz theory, exercises over a specified chord progression, a list of relevant compositions, and a transcribed solo which has been transposed and edited for concert pitch treble clef, B6, E6 and bass clef instruments. A thorough discussion of all facets of jazz theory, including major scale modes, forms and chord substitutions, melodic minor modes, diminished and whole-tone scales, pentatonic scales, and intervallic and "free" improvisation. The keying of the chord progressions to either the widespread Jamey Aebersold series or the compact disc accompanying Creative Beginnings. Exercises that include not only basic scales and arpeggios but also melodic ideas taken directly from cited recordings by master improvisers, arranged in order of relative difficulty. The indexing of the list of compositions to legal fake-books, particularly the New Real Book and the Aebersold play-along series. The correlation of half of the transcribed solos with the widely available anthology, The Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz. The convenience of allowing a classroom of mixed instrumentation to work simultaneously from the text. </p><p> Differences between the second and third editions include:</p><p>The addition of a new chapter, "Whom to Listen To," which lists major innovators, important contributors, and women in jazz. The expansion of the chapter on "Rhythm," with considerable new information and exercises. Replacement of two transcriptions with more readily playable examples, including Miles Davis's "Solea" solo (in place of Wayne Shorter's "Masqualero" solo), and Bill Evans's "Autumn Leaves" solo (in lieu of Dizzy Gillespie's "Stardust" solo). In addition, J. J. Johnson's solo on "Aquarius" has been renotated in long meter to make it easier to read. An expansion of the list of compositions in each chapter to reflect the ever-increasing number of play-along recordings by Jamey Aebersold. The third edition is now keyed to the first eighty-five volumes in his series, A New Approach to Jazz Improvisation. An extensive reworking of all portions of the text to improve readability and reflect recent information. A reappraisal of all exercises, with selected replacements and additions. The incorporation of inspirational epigraphs at the beginning of each chapter. A continued investigation of the how to bridge the gap between the technical and intellectual aspects of jazz with the creative and intuitive state of mind. Many of these ideas may be traced to my exposure to the concepts of pianist Kenny Werner, and I am indebted to his willingness to allow me to incorporate some of his ideas into this volume. </p><p> This text reflects the influences of my previous teachers, particularly David Baker, Woody Shaw, and Kenny Werner, the many jazz artists whose work I have studied and transcribed, and the pedagogical concepts of Jamey Aebersold. I gratefully acknowledge these people, as well as the staff at Prentice Hall, particularly my acquisitions editor, Christopher Johnson and my production and copy editor, Laura Lawrie. I sincerely hope the readers of this text will find it a valuable aid in their growth as musicians.</p></p><h2>Scales In First Position Violin (Rubank Educational Library)</h2><p>(String Method).

We all live in interiors, and most of us work, study, shop, and travel inside buildings, vehicles, and other enclosures. At one time or another, almost everyone has been an interior designer on a limited scale, when choosing a paint color or a rug, when buying furniture, or when arranging furniture in a new living place. For these reasons, interior design is&#x2014;or should be&#x2014;of interest to everyone. </p> <p> This book is concerned with the full range of interior design challenges, from the modest and everyday experiences at home and at work to full professional involvement in large projects. It is not a substitute for the level of professional training offered in design schools, for no one book of reasonable size can deal with every aspect of interior design at a level that will support professional practice. It is, rather, a survey of the field of interior design as it now exists. </p> <p> Thus, students embarking on a career in interior design will find in this book a comprehensive introduction to professional study. Readers interested in organizing residential interiors will find the basic information that they may need. This book will also provide a useful guide to those who will be choosing a designer or dealing with professionals in the field from time to time. </p> <p> Interior design is a complex and constantly changing field that has extensive overlap with related professions&#x2014;architecture in particular. Almost from its beginnings, the field of interior design has faced a division between a focus on historicism through the decorative reproduction of historical styles in interiors that most often were residential and an architectural orientation allied to the early twentieth-century movement known as Modernism that was more concerned with larger projects, such as offices, hotels, restaurants, and public buildings. This polarization into two conflicting approaches to interior design has now become obsolete. </p> <p> Contemporary architecture has developed an interest in historicism, not in terms of imitation, but with a willingness to learn from the past and incorporate historical reference into contemporary design. Meanwhile, the general public has moved toward an awareness and acceptance of modern design even in residential spaces, which for many was a last holdout against anything contemporary. These changes in attitude have given rise to a new design vocabulary, less concerned with decoration in formal historic styles and more focused on developing good solutions to the real problems of modern environmental circumstances. At the same time, designers are increasingly interested in seeking help from other specialized fields, such as sociology, economics, and psychology, in an effort to bring creative artistic expression and practical service into a stronger unity. </p> <p> In this book there is no intention to take sides in a nonproductive conflict of views. Rather, the intent is to introduce the reader to the best of past and present thinking, the best practices of both residential and professional design, and to provide a starting point for further reading, study, studio work, and practice. </p> <p> This third edition of <i>Interior Deign</i> has been extensively revised in text and illustrations to take account of design issues that have become of particular concern in the first decade of the twenty-first century. These issues, although touched on in previous editions, have now assumed greater importance to every designer, making it necessary to promote them to major themes in this edition. Three themes stand out as dominant new concerns. </p> <p> The first of these themes is social and environmental responsibility. In addition to concern for the needs and wishes of individual people, this edition reflects a growing concern for work that moves beyond the desire to please a client or generate a strong visual impact and toward increasing focus on consideration of social and environmental responsibility. Designers and often their clients are now aware of the impact of designed environments on the sustainability of the natural resources they consume and of other ways in which they themselves influence the world in which they exist. The choice of materials, products, and systems with awareness of these issues is known as <i>green deign,</i> and it can generate work as aesthetically satisfying as any earlier work. Many projects and materials illustrated here demonstrate this. The influence of the ideas of green design can be felt in almost every chapter. </p> <p> The second theme taking on new importance is the role of digital technology in the practice of interior design and in realized interior projects. Although most designers continue to value the hand skills associated with T square, triangle, and pencil, the computer and the techniques associated with its use are now essential elements of professional practice in even the smallest design firms. Use of the computer as a tool for drafting and perspective drawing has come into wide acceptance, while its value in researching, estimating, specifying and ordering, communicating, and marketing is now generally recognized as well. Early fears that individual creativity would in some way be reduced by electronic intervention have now largely given way to an understanding of how computers, intelligently used, can simplify and expedite design work, ultimately contributing to superior results. Spatial forms that were difficult or impossible to achieve are now in use thanks to computer capabilities, as many new illustrations suggest. Also, the entrance of computer technology into many residential and commercial spaces as a utility that must be designed for and as a tool for the control of a building's mechanical systems (lighting, heat, and air-conditioning) has called for new documentation in this edition. </p> <p> The third major theme of this edition is the increasing professionalization of the interior design field. Licensing laws and qualifying examinations are based on the growing realization that interior design is a serious matter with impact on the health, safety, and general well-being of the larger population that lives and works almost entirely within interior spaces. The responsibility that designers may have felt toward their clients and the larger public as a matter of conscience is now mandated by standards and codes having a legal basis. Specifics of such formal requirements are a significant part of this book. The increasing professionalism of the field has brought it into closer accord with the related design professions. Architects who were, in the past, often at odds with "mere decorators" are increasingly active as participants in the interior design field. At the same time, designers with recognized status as professionals find acceptance in cooperation with architects, often working within architectural organizations. </p> <p> The role of the amateur designer also survives, growing and prospering as those who design their own living space (perhaps with the aid of books such as this) approach the competence of professionals. The transition from amateur to professional, long a common route into design, is by no means closed, but the field now , demands much more than a sense of style. </p> <p> Since the appearance of the second edition, newly active designers and design firms have become known and have produced outstanding work. Many new illustrations and a number of new case studies document these developments. Older, well-established designers and firms continue to produce work that often incorporates fresh ideas. New illustrations make such current practice visible. </p> <p> The history chapter now includes expanded emphasis on non-Western traditions, and new technical developments, particularly in the field of lighting, are reviewed. An expanded and updated bibliography with a list of useful websites provides access for further research into every aspect of the interior design field, while an enlarged glossary makes it easier to check the meaning of technical terms of the field. In almost every chapter the concerns discussed above&#x2014;those of social and environmental responsibility, the expanding role of computer technology, and the increasing professionalism of the field&#x2014;are subjects of expanded concern and discussion. </p> <p> The interior designer of the twenty-first century, whether amateur or professional, faces a broadening and deepening sense of responsibility to the complex demands of the modern world. The field is more difficult now than it was in past years, but, as compensation, it is now more interesting than ever, offering greater service to its ultimate audience, the users of designed interior space. It is hoped that this book will constitute for the reader only the beginning of the learning process and that it will be supplemented by the identification, observation, and study of good work, which is the most significant form of education in any design field. </p> <p> <b>JOHN F.

Nonetheless, translating Rumi's astonishingly vast legacy with accessible accuracy is almost defiantly problematic due to the combined difficulties first of parsing the ancient language in which it was recorded and then of helping Western minds to grasp the manifold nuances of the poet's transcendant vision of the Beloved (i.e., God). But native Iranian Shiva (A Garden Beyond Paradise: The Mystical Poetry of Rumi with Jonathan Star) leaps the cross-cultural chasm with engaging panache. Of the 2000 quatrains amassed in Rumi's Divvan-e Shams-e Tabrizi, Shavi has chosen 252, rendering them simultaneously in the original Persian, in verbatim English transliterations and in faithfully polished translations. The result of this interactive method is a book that provides insight into the art of translating while plumbing the depth of Rumi's inspired passion. Included are a glossary of terms, a reference guide to Persian mysticism and a bibliography. <p></p><p>Copyright 1995 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Russian Vocabulary Cards: Academic Study Card Set</h2><p>The box contains 1,000 cards, but many cards have multiple words or word combinations, so the total vocabulary contained therein is about 3,000 words.

Why do some of us prefer the city to the country? How do urban settings increase crime? Why do we feel better after an experience in nature? <p> In this fascinating and enormously entertaining book, Winifred Gallagher explores the complex relationships between people and the places in which they live, love, and work. Drawing on the latest research on behavioral and environmental science, <i>The Power of Place</i> examines our reactions to light, temperature, the seasons, and other natural phenomena and explores the interactions between our external and internal worlds. </p><p> Gallagher's broad and dynamic definition of place includes mountaintops and the womb, Alaska's hinterlands and Manhattan's subway, and she relates these settings to everything from creativity to PMS, jet lag to tales of UFOs. </p><p> Full of complex information made totally accessible, <i>The Power of Place</i> offers the latest insights into the any ways we can change our lives by changing the places we live.</p></p><p>There are reasons why most humans love the mountains and why the great outdoors can do so much to soothe the urban jitters. Winifred Gallagher explains the inner workings of environmental psychology in <i>The Power of Place.</i> Traveling from northernmost Alaska, where the need to stay indoors for so much of the year takes a heavy mental and physical toll on the locals, to the artificial canyons of Manhattan, Gallagher strips off one civilizing layer after another to reveal the human animal within us, the creature that requires open spaces and clear air to function as it should. If you ever wondered why mountaineers take the risks they do or why Michael Jackson spent all that money on a hyperbaric chamber, Gallagher has the answer.<p>Winifred Gallagher is the author of <em>House Thinking</em>, <em>Just the Way You Are</em> (a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book), <em>Working on God</em>, and <em>Spiritual Genius</em>.

Over the decades, many African Americans have come to accept that natural areas are dangerous. Unfamiliar with the culture's rich environmental heritage, people overlook the knowledge and skills required at every turn in black history: thriving in natural settings in ancestral African lands, using and discovering farming techniques to survive during slavery and Reconstruction, and navigating escape routes to freedom, all of which required remarkable outdoor talents and a level of expertise far beyond what's needed to hike or camp in a national forest or park.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Rooted in the Earth</i>, environmental historian Dianne D.

Detailed instructions are given for utilizing hypnotherapeutic techniques for beginning treatment, ego strengthening, uncovering and abreaction, the reworking of uncovered material, the facilitation of the integrative process, the creation of a new identity, and the enhancement of spiritual development. Close attention is given to common pitfalls of therapy and how to avoid them, as well as how to deal with them effectively when they occur. The book is rich in clinical examples that illustrate the methods used. The authors have carefully considered the integration of various hypnotherapeutic techniques and the patient&#39;s internal resources with valuable external resources. The roles of adjunctive therapies, such as medication and hospitalization, body-oriented therapies, family and group approaches, and support groups, in the implementation of the treatment plan are thoroughly explored. Psychotherapy combined with hypnotic techniques is believed by many to be the treatment of choice today in working with dissociative patients. Unless therapists are adequately trained in the appropriate uses of hypnotic approaches when working with traumatic memory material, this can be a territory fraught with danger. Phillips and Frederick give readers both a map and a guidebook for this challenging journey in Healing the Divided Self.Maggie Phillips, Ph.D., is a psychologist in Oakland, California, where she has a private practice.

Each animal is introduced by name and given a brief yet tantalizing descriptive line. The same pattern is repeated for a tide pool on the English coast, a rain forest in the Amazon River basin, the grasslands of central Africa, an Australian forest, and a pond in the American Midwest. As an added challenge, and to make the point that ants live all over the world, one of these insects is hidden in each scene. Additional, well-chosen facts about these habitats and the depicted creatures are appended, along with an outline map of the locales. Filled with vibrant colors and palpable textures, the illustrations are breathtaking and give a real sense of the vitality, diversity, and beauty of nature. A first-rate foray into ecology that will encourage readers to explore the world around them.&#x2013;<i>Joy Fleishhacker, School Library Journal</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While we were waiting in line, Pascale's coworker, Steve, approached him and said, "Hey, Pascale! What's up?" </p><p>To me, this was a completely normal question and I was waiting to hear how he was going to reply. Instead, he looked confused, paused a moment, then cautiously stepped back and looked up. Amused, I rephrased the question for him to make things a little clearer. But Steve didn't stop there and kept right on firing away unmercifully: </p><p>"I couldn't get over how what's-'er-face got all bent outta shape yesterday and read me the riot act jus' 'cause I showed up a few minutes late ta work. Man, gimme a break! Betcha never saw anyone get so ticked off 'n freak out like that b'fore, huh?" </p><p>Pascale was obviously stunned and didn't know whether to answer "yes," "no," or to give Steve the correct time. After all his years of English study, there were two things he had never learned: how we speak colloquialisms, and what we speak--slang. </p><p>Colloquialisms covers the extensive array of contractions, pronunciation, and common usage characteristic of all native speakers of American-English. For example, any student of English would undoubtedly understand the following phrase: </p><p>"I am going to get upset if he does not quit what he is doing and stop bothering me!" </p><p>However, it is more likely to be pronounced like this: "I'm gonna ged upsed if 'e duz'n quit what 'e's doin' 'n stop botherin' me!" </p><p>Slang encompasses "secret" words and idioms that are consistently used in books, magazines, television, movies, songs, American homes, etc. and generally are reserved only for native speakers. The example above demonstrates how this phase would be spoken by a native; but a native speaker would most likely use slang words in place of the conventional words: "I am going to freak out if he does not knock it off and stop bugging me!" </p><p>And now, after adding the colloquial contractions, here is our final result:" I'm gonna freak oud if 'e duz'n knock id off 'n stop buggin' me!" </p><p>For the non-native speaker, learning the information in Street Talk-1 will equal years of living in America and eliminate the usual time it takes to absorb the intricacies of slang and colloquialisms. </p><p>For the American, you're in for a treat as we explore the evolution and variations of some of the most common hilarious expressions and slang terms handed down to us through the years. </p><p>Street Talk-1 is a self teaching guide divided into five parts: </p><p>Dialogue: Twenty to thirty new American expressions and terms (indicated in boldface) are presented as they may be heard in an actual conversation. A translation of the dialogue in standard English is always given on the opposite page followed by an important phonetic version of the dialogue as it would actually be spoken by an America. This page will prove vital to any non-native since, as previously demonstrated, Americans tend to rely heavily on contractions and shortcuts in pronunciation. </p><p>Vocabulary: This section spotlights all of the slang words and expressions that were used in the dialogue and offers more examples of usage, synonyms, antonyms, and special notes. </p><p>Practice the Vocabulary: These word games include all of the new terms and idioms previously learned and will help you to test yourself on your comprehension. (The pages providing the answers to all the drills are indicated at the beginning of this section.) </p><p>A Closer Look: This section offers the reader a unique look at common words used in slang expressions pertaining to a specific category such as Body Parts, Proper Names, Numbers, Colors, etc. A short drill is then presented in preparation for the final section. </p><p>Just for Fun: Here, the reader is offered an entertaining monologue containing many of the words for the same category as previously introduced. This section will surely prove to be hilarious for any native-speaker since it demonstrates the unlimited creativity of out own language. </p><p>If you have always prided yourself on being fluent in English, you will undoubtedly be surprised and amused to encounter a whole new world of phrases usually hidden away in the American-English language and usually reserved only for the native speaker...until now! </p><p>David Burke Author </p><p>Note: Slang falls into two very separate categories: suitable and proper as well as obscene and vulgar. In order to be truly fluent in any language, these two groups must be learned. Street Talk-1 focuses primarily on slang which is very acceptable and commonly used by everyone, and will only explore vulgarisms as far as translating some popular euphemisms created from vulgar expressions.</p></p><h2>The Riddles of Human Society</h2><p>This textbook uses the &#39;riddles&#39; metaphor to introduce social analysis and to communicate the critical, questioning aspects of sociology which are at the heart of its tradition. The book teaches the student how to be aware of the social &#39;riddles&#39; around them and how to solve those riddles using sociological analysis. Case studies, in-depth social analysis, illustrations and discussion questions make it the perfect book for active learning.</p><p>Conrad L.

Thus began the immortal adventures of Alice, perhaps the most popular heroine in English literature. Countless scholars have tried to define the charm of the <i>Alice </i>books&#x2013;with those wonderfully eccentric characters the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum, and Tweedledee, the Cheshire Cat, Mock Turtle, the Mad Hatter <i>et al.&#x2013;</i>by proclaiming that they really comprise a satire on language, a political allegory, a parody of Victorian children&#x2019;s literature, even a reflection of contemporary ecclesiastical history. Perhaps, as Dodgson might have said, <i>Alice </i>is no more than a dream, a fairy tale about the trials and tribulations of growing up&#x2013;or down, or all turned round&#x2013;as seen through the expert eyes of a child.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

Work on the roles of extracellular proteins in tissue development led to discovery of several novel families of non-fibrillar collagens and uncovered disease mechanisms in many collagen-based osteochondrodysplasias and other disorders. Other studies identified mutations in the transcription factors HOXD13 and RUNX2 in polysyndactyly and cleidocranial dysplasia. Mapping of the genes for craniofacial disorders, such as cherubism and craniometaphyseal dysplasia led to identification of causative mutations in the siganling regulator SH3BP2, and the pyrophosphate transporter ANK. In research on pathogenetic mechanisms of vascular anomalies, the Olsen laboratory discovered that activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase TIE2 cause venous malformations and identified mutations/ polymorphisms and signqling mechanisms associated with the rapid growth of infantile hemangioma, the most common tumor of infancy. By addressing questions related to skeletal development and vascular disease, the Olsen laboratory has been able to characterize complex developmental and disease mechanisms at the intersection between skeletal and vascular biology. This has recently led to new insights into unexpected intracellular mechanisms by which vascular endothelial growth factor A controls differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts and adipocytes during bone development and postnatal repair. <br>Dr. Olsen has received many awards and honors, including Honorary Doctor of Science Degrees from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, University of Oslo, Norway, Okayama University, Japan, and Oulu University, Finland; Research Prizes and Awards from American Association of Anatomists, American Society of Matrix Biology, International Association of Dental Research, International Society of Matrix Biology and British Society for Matrix Biology.

Because of the leverage inherent in commodity futures, more fortunes are made and lost more quickly than in any other markets. Yet, with all the potential that the commodity futures markets have, few really make out well. Do you wonder why that is?</p> <p><b>Why this book? </b></p> <p>I've been trading for more than 25 years now. As head of a trading firm working with individuals and corporations alike, I've witnessed thousands of trades and participated in thousands more. I've seen fortunes won and lost. After awhile, you do learn a few things, and it's my goal to share some of what I've learned with you. Hopefully, I can save you some of the grief I've experienced and give you a jump-start on the road to success. Of course, I'm still learning and still have a lot left to learn. This, the third edition of Trading Commodities and Financial Futures, is probably my last book (I'm a trader, not a writer) and no doubt my best work. I call it my best work (with all due modesty) because I've grown older, and as you grow older, you learn more. Some call trading a young man's game; however, I can honestly say that after 25 years in the business, I now trade with less stress and better results than I did when I was younger and more impulsive. This is because the older one gets, the less important ego becomes&#x2014;and I've seen the disasters that can result when ego takes precedence over the major prevailing trend of the marketplace.</p> <p> Without trying to be all things to all people, I've written this book for both novice and seasoned traders. It is meant to be a primer and reference source for those of you who are seriously considering, but have not yet taken, the plunge into the shark-infested commodity waters. This book is also designed to help those of you who are currently trading and want to perform better. What will it take to succeed? You'll need patience, guts, discipline, and vision. I cannot infuse these qualities into you; instead, I can tell you only what to look for and what to watch out for. We'll start slow and then build up to a master trading plan. Along the way, I'll share some good stories with you. </p> <p><b>Why trade commodities now?</b></p> <p>I entered this crazy business during the commodities boom of the late 1970s. The Hunt brothers were attempting to corner the silver market, the Carter Administration couldn't get a grip on inflation, the currency markets were in turmoil, the Russians were invading Afghanistan, the world was running out of food due to a series of weather disasters, the Iranians were holding American citizens hostage, and there was an energy crisis. Hard assets were in vogue. Paper assets were just that. During the 1970s, the CRB Index (basket of commodities) appreciated well over 100%. The Dow Jones Index (basket of "blue chip" U.S. stocks) literally went nowhere for more than 10 years. </p> <p> Here's an interesting (and frightening) statistic: The world is adding to its population at the rate of the country of Mexico every year&#x2014;that's more than 80 million people. If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely 100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same, it would look approximately like this: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Just 14 people would be from the western hemisphere (only 5 from the United States).</p> </li> <li> <p>27 would be from Africa, Australia, Europe, and the Middle East combined.</p> </li> <li> <p>57 would be Asian (38 from China and India). </p> </li> </ul> <p>The rapid movement of China and India into the mainstream of the world economy is generating new demands for commodities, the likes of which have never been experienced. As just one example, take a look at oil. Today, the United States consumes approximately one quarter of all the oil produced; this is approximately 25 barrels per capita per year. When Japan accelerated its economic growth (from 1950 to 1970), Japanese oil consumption rose from 1 barrel per capita per year to more than 17 barrels. China and India are now in the early stages of a similar growth curve, today consuming just over 1 barrel per capita per year. China and India's combined populations are 18 times that of Japan. As their consumer economies continue to expand, it's hard to fathom the stress that will be placed on the world's limited and diminishing capacity to produce crude oil (or metals, or food for that matter). </p> <p> China, in particular, is in the back of investor's minds these days because it is driving the most powerful investment trend witnessed since the tech bubble burst in 2000. Look at food consumption trends. China has a huge population with a rapidly growing economy and a growing middle class. As its population becomes richer, subsistence-level eating just isn't good enough. China can't grow enough food to feed its people (which is behind the huge exports of soybeans and wheat to China). All nations face a crop failure every decade or so. What happens when one of the world's major food producers such as the United States, Brazil, or China has the next one? In 1995, due to a poor domestic crop, China turned from the largest corn exporter in Asia into a corn importer. It was no coincidence that this was the year of the greatest bull corn market in history, with corn prices surging from less than $2 per bushel to more than $5. </p> <p> Chinese agriculture brings about other demands. For example, a large part of increasing the efficiency of Chinese agriculture is fertilizer. Good fertilization could dramatically increase China's ability to produce the basic foodstuffs it needs, and most fertilizers contain a mineral known as potash&#x2014;a mineral China simply doesn't have enough of. In fact, industry estimates put China's requirements at about 10 million tons five years from now, of which it is able to produce only about a million tons domestically. When I wrote the first edition of this book, nobody had ever heard of the Dalian Commodity Exchange in China. Today, it is the ninth largest exchange in the world&#x2014;and growing. The Chinese factor is not going away. Instead, it is accelerating the demand for commodities&#x2014;everything from gold to copper to soybeans to wheat&#x2014;and as a result, this decade and beyond will be the era of a new and sustained mega-bull market for commodities.</p> <p><b>For now, think of this as a game </b></p> <p>Financial markets come in many flavors. Think of commodity futures and options trading as a game&#x2014;the highest stakes money game in the world, where fortunes are made and lost daily. Sure, there's a loftier purpose. Governments allow the traditional financial markets to operate for the purpose of capital formation. Futures markets are allowed to operate as a vehicle of risk transference for commodity producers and users. However, this book is not a scholarly treatise, and it is not about investing for your retirement. It is a guide to winning the game. </p> <p><b>A game with consequences</b></p> <p>If you choose to play the game, be forewarned that it can dramatically affect your lifestyle. For every buyer of a gold, copper, bond, cattle, or Euro contract, there is someone unseen (but out there) on the other side of the transaction. The buyer is known as the long and the seller as the short. At any point in time, except for the split second when a new trade is initiated, someone is winning, and someone is losing. You should understand from the outset that commodity futures are a zero sum game. For every dollar won by one player, someone else loses that same dollar. Accurate statistics are not available, but it generally is agreed that the great majority of players lose this game. Because this game is zero sum, by definition, the great minority are winning what this majority is losing. This is one of the reasons the stakes are so high. Fortunes are made in commodity futures, in some cases starting with an extremely small stake. Luck might play a part in the short run, but in the end, only those players who play the game better will triumph. No method is foolproof, so the best I can do is help you to place the odds in your favor. If I am able to accomplish this, and you are able to act in a disciplined manner, success is assured. Sound simple? If it were so simple, most people wouldn't lose, and the nature of the markets is to punish the majority. The purpose of this book is to place you in the minority, because it is the minority who will reap the rewards!</p> <p> <b>George Kleinman</b> <br>2004</p> <br> <p>� Copyright Pearson Education.

Yoshimi</b>, Columbia University</p></p><h2>Mansfield Park (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Mansfield Park is a study of three families - the Bertrams, the Crawfords, and the Prices - with the isolated figure of the heroine, Fanny Price, at its centre. Fanny's quiet passivity, her steadfast loyalty and love for the son of the family who regard her as the poor relation, are among the<br>qualities whose true worth is not appreciated until they are tried against the brilliant and witty Mary and Henry Crawford, the unfortunate consequences of whose influence are felt by everyone. Jane Austen uses Fanny's emotional involvement with the people around her to explore the social and moral<br>values by which she and they try to order their lives.<br><br>First published in 1814, the text of this edition is taken from R. W. Chapman's Oxford edition.</p><p>Though Jane Austen was writing at a time when Gothic potboilers such as Ann Ward Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i> and Horace Walpole's <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> were all the rage, she never got carried away by romance in her own novels. In Austen's ordered world, the passions that ruled Gothic fiction would be horridly out of place; marriage was, first and foremost, a contract, the bedrock of polite society. Certain rules applied to who was eligible and who was not, how one courted and married and what one expected afterwards. To flout these rules was to tear at the basic fabric of society, and the consequences could be terrible. Each of the six novels she completed in her lifetime are, in effect, comic cautionary tales that end happily for those characters who play by the rules and badly for those who don't. In <i>Mansfield Park</i>, for example, Austen gives us Fanny Price, a poor young woman who has grown up in her wealthy relatives' household without ever being accepted as an equal. The only one who has truly been kind to Fanny is Edmund Bertram, the younger of the family's two sons. <p> Into this Cinderella existence comes Henry Crawford and his sister, Mary, who are visiting relatives in the neighborhood. Soon Mansfield Park is given over to all kinds of gaiety, including a daring interlude spent dabbling in theatricals. Young Edmund is smitten with Mary, and Henry Crawford woos Fanny. Yet these two charming, gifted, and attractive siblings gradually reveal themselves to be lacking in one essential Austenian quality: principle. Without good principles to temper passion, the results can be disastrous, and indeed, <i>Mansfield Park</i> is rife with adultery, betrayal, social ruin, and ruptured friendships. But this <i>is</i> a comedy, after all, so there is also a requisite happy ending and plenty of Austen's patented gentle satire along the way. Describing the switch in Edmund's affections from Mary to Fanny, she writes: "I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that everyone may be at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable passions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as to time in different people." What does <i>not</i> vary is the pleasure with which new generations come to Jane Austen. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>In recent years, Mansfield Park has come to be regarded as Austen&#39;s most controversial novel. It was published in two editions in her lifetime and here the differences between the first edition and the second, including some important amendments made by Jane Austen herself, are clearly noted on the page. The volume provides comprehensive notes, an extensive critical introduction covering the context and publication history of the work, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual appa ratus. This edition is indispensable for all serious scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>Cranial Manipulation Theory and Practice: Osseous and Soft Tissue Approaches</h2><p>An easy-to-follow, well illustrated clinical introduction to cranial manipulation techniques and the related theory and research evidence.

Following the fortunes of a group of painters and decorators and their families, and the attempts to rouse their political will by the Socialist visionary Frank Owen, the book is both a highly entertaining story and a passionate appeal for a fairer way of life. It asks questions that are still being asked today: why do your wages bear no relation to the value of your work? Why do fat cats get richer when you don't? Tressell's answers are "The Great Money Trick" and the "philanthropy" of an unenlightened workforce, who give away their rights and aspirations to a decent life so freely.<br><br>Intellectually enlightening, deeply moving and gloriously funny (complete with exploding clergyman), <em>The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</em> is a book that changes lives.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

It tells the story of Tony Last, who, to the irritation of his wife, is inordinately obsessed with his Victorian Gothic country house and life. When Lady Brenda Last embarks on an affair with the worthless John Beaver out of boredom with her husband, she sets in motion a sequence of tragicomic disasters that reveal Waugh at his most scathing. <br><br>The action is set in the brittle social world recognizable from Decline and Fall and Vile Bodies, darkened and deepened by Waugh&#x2019;s own experience of sexual betrayal. As Tony is driven by the urbane savagery of this world to seek solace in the wilds of the Brazilian jungle, <i>A Handful of Dust </i> demonstrates the incomparably brilliant and wicked wit of one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most accomplished novelists.</p><p><i>"All over England people were waking up, queasy and despondent."</i><p> Few writers have walked the line between farce and tragedy as nimbly as Evelyn Waugh, who employed the conventions of the comic novel to chip away at the already crumbling English class system. His 1934 novel, <i>A Handful of Dust</i>, is a sublime example of his bleak satirical style: a mordantly funny expos� of aristocratic decadence and ennui in England between the wars.</p><p> Tony Last is an aristocrat whose attachment to an ideal feudal past is so profound that he is blind to his wife Brenda's boredom with the stately rhythms of country life. While he earnestly plays the lord of the manor in his ghastly Victorian Gothic pile, she sets herself up in a London flat and pursues an affair with the social-climbing idler John Beaver. In the first half of the novel Waugh fearlessly anatomizes the lifestyles of the rich and shameless. Everyone moves through an endless cycle of parties and country-house weekends, being scrupulously polite in public and utterly horrid in private. Sex is something one does to relieve the boredom, and Brenda's affair provides a welcome subject for conversation: </p><blockquote> It had been an autumn of very sparse and meagre romance; only the most obvious people had parted or come together, and Brenda was filling a want long felt by those whose simple, vicarious pleasure it was to discuss the subject in bed over the telephone. </blockquote> Tony's indifference and Brenda's selfishness give their relationship a sort of equilibrium until tragedy forces them to face facts. The collapse of their relationship accelerates, and in the famous final section of the book Tony seeks solace in a foolhardy search for El Dorado, throwing himself on the mercy of a jungle only slightly more savage than the one he leaves behind in England. For all its biting wit, <i>A Handful of Dust</i> paints a bleak picture of the English upper classes, reaching beyond satire toward a very modern sense of despair. In Waugh's world, culture, breeding, and the trappings of civilization only provide more subtle means of destruction. <i>--Simon Leake</i>8 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Teaching Social Studies in Early Education</h2><p>Teachers and child caregivers will love this new book because it clearly combines the theory and practice of teaching social studies to young children.

Introduced by Rudolf Steiner in collaboration with Emil and Berta Molt, CEO of the Waldorf Astoria Cigarette Factory, following the chaos in Germany after WWI, the recognition that a new social order was needed sparked the enlightened industrialist to act through education with Steiner&#x2019;s insight as a lodestar to the endeavor. Goals of the philosophy were to develop in the young new and flexible thinking to inspire genuinely new thoughts to produce social forms unique to the 20th century and the coming new Millennium.</p><p></p><h2>Never Use Futura (The history of a typeface)</h2><p>It's everywhere, including the moon (on the commemorative plaque left by Apollo 11 astronauts), Nike sneakers, the artworks of Barbara Kruger, Ed Ruscha, and Jenny Holzer, <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> credits, Domino's Pizza boxes, Absolut Vodka bottles, and Red Bull cans. Futura and its typographic offspring have been the face of presidential campaigns from Richard Nixon to Hillary Clinton. Indeed, Futura is one of the most used fonts in the world today&#x2014;the typeface of modern design&#x2014;more so even than Helvetica. This fascinating book explores the cultural history and uses of a face that's so common you might not notice, until you start looking, and then you can't escape it. Douglas Thomas traces Futura from its Bauhaus-inspired origin in Paul Renner's 1924 design, to its current role as the go-to choice for corporate work, logos, motion pictures, and advertisements. <em>Never Use Futura</em> is illuminating, sometimes playful, reading, not just for type nerds, but for anyone interested in how typefaces are used, take on meaning, and become a language of their own.</p><p>Douglas Thomas is a graphic designer, writer, and historian. He holds an MA in history from the University of Chicago and an MFA in graphic design from the Maryland Institute College of Art, where he also taught. He currently teaches at Brigham Young University. His design work has been featured in <em>Communication Arts</em>, <em>Print</em> magazine, and <em>Graphis</em>.<i>"Never Use Futura</i>&nbsp;tells a smart, incisive story about the way one typeface became woven into our cultural sentiments and movements. New designers will start to notice Futura everywhere. Seasoned designers will see layers of meaning in Futura (and its look-alikes) everywhere.&nbsp;In either case, <i>Never Use Futura</i> may change the way you see our world."&nbsp;- Maya Lim, <i>Design Observer</i> <br><br>"Thomas's wonderful book charts [Futura's] history in an inviting, digestible way."&nbsp;<br>- <i>Metropolis&nbsp;</i><br><br>"The result is a contemporary lens upon the face, showing its application in film titles and interior motifs for Wes Andersen, campaign buttons for Richard Nixon and artwork by Barbara Kruger. Must read." - Steven Heller, <i>Print</i><br><br>"Helvetica, much as I adore it, has had more than its fair share of attention. That's why I'm so happy to see this new book by designer, writer, and historian Douglas Thomas all about the typeface Futura which, it's worth noting, predated Helvetica by <i>three full decades</i>--and it looks as beautiful and timely as ever." - Khoi Vihn, Subtraction.com</p><h2>Late Victorian Architectural Plans and Details (Dover Architecture)</h2><p>This authentic reproduction of plans drawn up by a noted nineteenth-century architectural firm features both residential and public buildings.

Razor sharp . . . piercingly profound.&#34; Once again, Ellison&#39;s writing defies all labels. These seventeen stories by a modern master are an &#34;assembled artifact&#34; of anger and faith - as bittersweet as a&#34;jalapeno-laced cinnamon bear.&#34; The sixteen stories collected here are spread over the farthest stretches of time and space, but even the bleakest of them is warmed by a passionate faith in the endurance of life and its ultimate possibilities.</p><p>Harlan Ellison has won countless awards in his literary career, including the Edgar, the Hugo, and the Nebula. He lives in California.Ellison's first book in six years, a harvesting of previously uncollected stories, is one of his best. The 17 stories are prefaced by "The Wind Took Your Answer Away," a remembrance and homage to the author's friends who have died since 1985and there have been manywritten with sadness and rage. Indeed, death or mourning figure in many of these tales. "Paladin of the Lost Hour" is an overly sentimental tale of an old man who keeps guard over an exiled hour that must never enter the time stream, lest time itself come to an end, and how he passes on his stewardship. Funny and intriguing, "Laugh Track" features a magician of a sound editor who conjures up the soul of the long-dead favorite aunt of a Hollywood writer from the sound of her laughter on an ancient sitcom laugh track. "Prince Mishkin, and Hold the Relish" is an hilarious anecdotal short-short about messed-up relationships between men and women and Dostoyevski. The urban horror story "Soft Monkey" tells of a retarded homeless old woman who witnesses a murder and is in turn pursued by the killers. Ellison's stories have too often been mechanistic, thin ideas fleshed out in overwriting and sentimentality. In this collection he demonstrates he's moving beyond that, becoming more complex, relaxed and reaching for emotion rather than sentiment. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Convicting the Innocent: Where Criminal Prosecutions Go Wrong</h2><p><p>On January 20, 1984, Earl Washington-defended for all of forty minutes by a lawyer who had never tried a death penalty case-was found guilty of rape and murder in the state of Virginia and sentenced to death. After nine years on death row, DNA testing cast doubt on his conviction and saved his life. However, he spent another eight years in prison before more sophisticated DNA technology proved his innocence and convicted the guilty man.</p><p>DNA exonerations have shattered confidence in the criminal justice system by exposing how often we have convicted the innocent and let the guilty walk free. In this unsettling in-depth analysis, Brandon Garrett examines what went wrong in the cases of the first 250 wrongfully convicted people to be exonerated by DNA testing.</p><p>Based on trial transcripts, Garrett's investigation into the causes of wrongful convictions reveals larger patterns of incompetence, abuse, and error. Evidence corrupted by suggestive eyewitness procedures, coercive interrogations, unsound and unreliable forensics, shoddy investigative practices, cognitive bias, and poor lawyering illustrates the weaknesses built into our current criminal justice system. Garrett proposes practical reforms that rely more on documented, recorded, and audited evidence, and less on fallible human memory. </p><p>Very few crimes committed in the United States involve biological evidence that can be tested using DNA. How many unjust convictions are there that we will never discover? <i>Convicting the Innocent</i> makes a powerful case for systemic reforms to improve the accuracy of all criminal cases.</p></p><p>Brandon L. Garrett is Roy L. and Rosamond Woodruff Morgan Professor of Law at the University of Virginia School of Law.For six years now I have worked diligently within the innocence movement, and I often hear the question: 'How do wrongful convictions happen?' <i>Convicting the Innocent</i> gives all the answers. It is a fascinating study of what goes wrong, and it clearly shows that virtually all wrongful convictions could have been avoided. (John Grisham)<br><br>DNA testing is revolutionizing our system of criminal justice: this book shows why. By digging deep into the case files of exonerees, Brandon Garrett uncovers what went wrong in those cases and probably in many more we simply can't know about. Garrett makes a powerful case for how to improve criminal justice so that we dramatically reduce the number of wrongly convicted. (Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, The Innocence Project)<br><br>This is an invaluable book, a comprehensive, highly readable but well-researched work examining the hows and whys of the law's ultimate nightmare--convicting the innocent. (Scott Turow, author of <i>Innocent</i>)<br><br>How can we stop sending innocent people to our prisons? As you turn the pages of this important and startling book, you will come to realize that wrongful convictions are not accidents. They are the tragic result of a criminal justice system in deep need of reform. (Sister Helen Prejean, author of <i>Dead Man Walking</i>)<br><br>It's common to say that DNA exonerations of innocent defendants provide a unique window on the weaknesses in our system of criminal investigation and trial. But what exactly do we see when we look through that window? Until now the answer has been pretty sketchy. Brandon Garrett has produced a far more detailed and complete picture of the lessons of DNA exonerations than anything else to date. This is an indispensable book for anyone wanting to understand or improve American criminal justice. (Samuel R. Gross, Thomas and Mabel Long Professor of Law, University of Michigan)<br><br>Garrett's book is a gripping contribution to the literature of injustice, along with a galvanizing call for reform...It's the stories in his book that stick in the memory. One can only hope that they will mobilize a broad range of citizens, liberal and conservative, to demand legislative and judicial reforms ensuring that the innocent go free whether or not the constable has blundered. (Jeffrey Rosen <i>New York Times Book Review</i> 2011-05-29)<br><br>Looking at the 250 people exonerated through DNA as of February 2010, Garrett aimed to determine how often...malignant factors had warped the criminal justice process at the expense of an innocent person (and to the benefit of an actual criminal who went unpursued). Garrett tracked down court transcripts and dug into case files. He then sliced, diced, sifted and collated the data. Some law professors would take a pass on this kind of grunt work. Garrett did not, and our justice system can be the better for it. (Kevin Doyle <i>America</i> 2011-08-15)<br><br>While false convictions are a recognized phenomenon, Garrett focuses much needed attention on potential solutions, offering concrete suggestions for reform. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2011-08-15)<br><br>This book details some of the worst miscarriages of justice in U.S. history and describes how DNA evidence helped to right those wrongs...The book, what must be the most thorough treatment yet of wrongful convictions, is a first-rate examination of the human foibles and conflicts of interest hampering the pursuit of justice. (A. C. Mobley <i>Choice</i> 2011-12-01)<br><br>A uniquely valuable part of Garrett's book is a statistical appendix that provides a quantitative overview of the false convictions, their consequences, and the factors that contributed to them....It is hard to imagine seven pages more damaging to the claims of our system of criminal justice.

Lewontin <i>New York Review of Books</i> 2012-02-23)</p><h2>Premarital &amp; Remarital Counseling: the Professional's Handbook</h2><p>The definitive guide to premarital counseling<br> <br> This is the best premarital counseling guide I have seen in more than three decades in the family therapy and family life education fields.<br> -- William C.

Swept away by his expectation that the Messiah was coming, he came to believe that he could deny death and change history.</p><br><p> Samuel Heilman and Menachem Friedman paint an unforgettable portrait of Schneerson, showing how he reinvented himself from an aspiring French-trained electrical engineer into a charismatic leader who believed that he and his Lubavitcher Hasidic emissaries could transform the world. They reveal how his messianic convictions ripened and how he attempted to bring the ancient idea of a day of redemption onto the modern world's agenda. Heilman and Friedman also trace what happened after the Rebbe's death, by which time many of his followers had come to think of him as the Messiah himself.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Rebbe</i> tracks Schneerson's remarkable life from his birth in Russia, to his student days in Berlin and Paris, to his rise to global renown in New York, where he developed and preached his powerful spiritual message from the group's gothic mansion in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. This compelling book demonstrates how Schneerson's embrace of traditionalism and American-style modernity made him uniquely suited to his messianic mission.</p></p><p><br><p>"Brilliant, well-researched, and sure to be controversial, <i>The Rebbe</i> is the most important biography of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson ever to appear. Samuel Heilman and Menachem Friedman, two of the world's foremost sociologists of religion, have produced a landmark study of Chabad, religious messianism, and one of the greatest spiritual figures of the twentieth century."<b>--Jonathan D. Sarna, author of<i>American Judaism: A History</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"<i>The Rebbe</i> is a must-read book for anyone concerned with contemporary Jewry as well as for historians of religion. Heilman and Friedman have done a masterful job of combining impeccable scholarship with a great sense of the drama unfolding before them. They dispel myths and restore the Rebbe to the real world of humanity, doing so with sensitivity and warmth."<b>--Arthur Green, author of<i>Tormented Master: The Life and Spiritual Quest of Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"This book offers a deeply engaging and well-researched account of the rise to power of one of the most intriguing religious figures of the twentieth century, Jewish or otherwise. There are few subjects in the study of contemporary Judaism of greater interest or relevance than the messianic legacy of the Rebbe. This book will become the definitive study on the subject."<b>--David N. Myers, author of<i>Between Jew and Arab</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"This is a timely and important book.

Or is there some core aspect of the extermination of the Jews of Europe which resists our powers of depiction, of theory, of narrative? In this volume, twenty scholars probe the moral, epistemological, and aesthetic limits of an account or portrayal of the Nazi horror.</p><p>Christopher Browning, Hayden White, Carlo Ginzburg, Martin Jay, Dominick LaCapra, and others focus first on the general question: can the record of his historical event be established objectively through documents and witnesses, or is every historical interpretation informed by the perspective of its narrator? The suggestion that all historical accounts are determined by a preestablished narrative choice raises the ethical and intellectual issues of various forms of relativization. In more specific terms, what are the possibilities of historicizing National Socialism without minimizing the historical place of the Holocaust?</p><p>Also at issue are the problems related to an artistic representation, particularly the dilemmas posed by aestheticization. John Felstiner, Yael S. Feldman, Sidra Ezrahi, Eric Santner, and Anton Kaes grapple with these questions and confront the inadequacy of words in the face of the Holocaust. Others address the problem of fitting Nazi policies and atrocities into the history of Western thought and science. The book concludes with Geoffrey Hartman&#x2019;s evocative meditation on memory.</p><p>These essays expose to scrutiny questions that have a pressing claim on our attention, our conscience, and our cultural memory. First presented at a conference organized by Saul Friedlander, they are now made available for the wide consideration and discussion they merit.</p></p><p>Born in Prague, Saul Friedlander spent his boyhood in Nazi-occupied France. He is a professor of history at UCLA, and has written numerous books on Nazi Germany and World War II.&#x201c;What might it mean to call the Holocaust a &#x2019;crisis in form&#x2019;...the Shoah nonetheless challenges our powers to draw something like a meaning, or maybe even more than one, from this powerful sense of meaningfulness. At the same time that it renders the task of historical comprehension ethically imperative, it threatens to expose the inadequacies, or at the very least the limitations of our familiar modes of coming to understand cultural events.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Irene Tucker</b><b>, </b><b><i>Poetics Today</i></b></p><h2>The Art of the Song Recital</h2><p>The definitive work in its field!

The 120 works range from little-known pieces originally appearing <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> to such celebrated essays as "The Plight of Our Culture" (1953), "Modernist Painting" (1960), and "Post Painterly Abstraction" (1964). Preserved in their original form, these writings allow readers to witness the development and direction of Greenberg's criticism, from his advocacy of abstract expressionism to his enthusiasm for color-field painting.<br> <br> With the inclusion of critical exchanges between Greenberg and F. R. Leavis, Fairfield Porter, Thomas B. Hess, Herbert Read, Max Kozloff, and Robert Goldwater, these volumes are essential sources in the ongoing debate over modern art. For each volume, John O'Brian has furnished an introduction, a selected bibliography, and a brief summary of events that places the criticism in its artistic and historical context.</p></p><p>The essays and criticism in this volume consist of published writings only, arranged chronologically in the order of their first appearance.

On radio and in print, Greenberg was the voice of "the new American painting," and a central figure in the postwar cultural history of the United States.<br><br>Greenberg first established his reputation writing for the <i>Partisan Review</i>, which he joined as an editor in 1940. He became art critic for&nbsp;<i>The Nation</i> in 1942, and was associate editor of <i>Commentary</i> from 1945 until 1957. His seminal essay, "Avant-Garde and Kitsch" set the terms for the ongoing debate about the relationship of modern high art to popular culture.

At the same time, this book provides an avenue for a more seasoned therapist to pursuing ongoing development. The text is substantive with a powerful reinforcement of pragmatic, sound principles that are integral to the practice of family therapy, regardless of the theoretical approach. The logical, organized presentation of topics helps organize the therapist's thinking about managing the family therapy process, beginning with the elements that serve as a foundation on which a family therapist develops skill, and progressing to strategies for ongoing skill development. Taibbi addresses a wide spectrum of topics....Select case studies are artfully used throughout the text to illustrate each principle as the principle is discussed. All of this is done within the context of today's health care climate, embracing the concept of clients as active partners in their own care and accounting for realistic situations such as limited resources. This book can easily serve as an introductory text for teaching family therapy. It could also be used to facilitate supervision....For the novice and expert alike, one of the strongest features of this book is the carefully constructed, thought-provoking questions at the end of each chapter....The end-of-chapter exercises can serve as an antidote to the wear and tear a therapist might experience at any point."

A Passion, I was touched by Michael Ginor's respect for and fascination with foie gras. It is at the same time a dignified study of foie gras and a beautifully illustrated work, rich in its international selection of recipes. Bravo, Monsieur!"<br>--Alain Ducasse, Chef-Restaurateur<br><br>"At last, the perfect gift for the voluptuary."<br>--Gael Greene, New York magazine<br><br>"An incredible odyssey! Foie Grass ... A Passion is a thoroughly exquisite overview of my favorite subject. This book is a magnificent culinary tribute-a feast for all the senses! Simply, a must-have selection for everyone's culinary library."<br>--Jean-Louis Palladin, Chef-Restaurateur<br><br>"Foie Gras ... A Passion is an exercise in monomania of the most appealing sort."<br>--Russ Parsons, Los Angeles Times<br><br>"This book, reflecting elegance and intellect, tells a story of immense passion. In tracing the history of foie gras, the authors carry us along through culinary traditions, ethnic cultures, and across continents. The recipes challenge the imagination and the palate."<br>--Ferdinand Metz, President, The Culinary Institute of America<br><br>"As much a coffee table book as a cookbook, this beautiful celebration of foie gras includes a thorough history of the delicacy and mouthwatering full-page photographs of each of the dishes. Those who get past turning the pretty pages can sample the foie gras inspired recipes ... a veritable who's who of contemporary chefs."<br>--Food &amp; Wine's Best of the Best</p><p>Rich and silky, fresh foie gras is one of the world's great foods. But until the mid-80s, due to importation restrictions and without domestic production, none was available here. Michael A. Ginor, proprietor of Hudson Valley Foie Gras, was among the first to establish production of domestic duck foie gras, which excited the livers' current popularity. <i>Foie Gras: A Passion</i>, by Ginor and Mitchell Davis, celebrates foie gras in words and pictures; though it contains 80 chef-created foie gras recipes, accompanied by alluring color photos, the book is best appreciated for its thorough exploration of its subject. Those interested in this extraordinary specialty, and its place in modern American cooking, will embrace the book.<p> Commencing with a comprehensive exploration of foie gras history, which began with geese domestication in ancient Egypt, and continuing with an exploration of its production and use in Europe and America (there's a fascinating glimpse of foie gras's role in 19th-century Jewish cooking), the book then limns the modern methods by which foie gras is obtained and sold. The authors also address animal rights issues--they maintain that liver-fattening methods respect the birds' eating habits and physiology--and provide notes on wine and foie gras pairings as well as practical purchasing, cooking, and handling information. Recipes such as Caramelized Torte of Foie Gras, Smoked Eel, Spring Onion, and Apple are featured, as are the work of chefs including Andr� Daguin, Emeril Lagasse, Jacques P�pin, and Charlie Trotter. If the recipes are beyond the reach (and pocketbook) of most cooks, there is much else to enjoy and ponder in this singular food book, a vital addition to a culinary library. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>"As much a coffee table book as a cookbook, this beautiful celebration of foie gras includes a thorough history of the delicacy and mouthwatering full-page photographs of each of the dishes.

An insightful, well-written, and thought-provoking book that illumines each of the many aspects of American culture that it touches." &#x2013; &nbsp;Kenneth Keniston in <i>The New York Times</i></p><h2>Big Hunger: The Unholy Alliance between Corporate America and Anti-Hunger Groups (Food, Health, and the Environment)</h2><p><p><b>How to focus anti-hunger efforts not on charity but on the root causes of food insecurity, improving public health, and reducing income inequality.</b></p><p>Food banks and food pantries have proliferated in response to an economic emergency. The loss of manufacturing jobs combined with the recession of the early 1980s and Reagan administration cutbacks in federal programs led to an explosion in the growth of food charity. This was meant to be a stopgap measure, but the jobs never came back, and the &#x201c;emergency food system&#x201d; became an industry. In <i>Big Hunger</i>, Andrew Fisher takes a critical look at the business of hunger and offers a new vision for the anti-hunger movement.</p><p>From one perspective, anti-hunger leaders have been extraordinarily effective. Food charity is embedded in American civil society, and federal food programs have remained intact while other anti-poverty programs have been eliminated or slashed. But anti-hunger advocates are missing an essential element of the problem: economic inequality driven by low wages. Reliant on corporate donations of food and money, anti-hunger organizations have failed to hold business accountable for offshoring jobs, cutting benefits, exploiting workers and rural communities, and resisting wage increases. They have become part of a &#x201c;hunger industrial complex&#x201d; that seems as self-perpetuating as the more famous military-industrial complex.</p><p>Fisher lays out a vision that encompasses a broader definition of hunger characterized by a focus on public health, economic justice, and economic democracy. He points to the work of numerous grassroots organizations that are leading the way in these fields as models for the rest of the anti-hunger sector. It is only through approaches like these that we can hope to end hunger, not just manage it.</p></p><p>Andrew Fisher has worked in the anti-hunger field for twenty-five years, as the executive director of national and local food groups, and as a researcher, organizer, policy advocate, and coalition builder. He has led successful efforts to gain passage of multiple pieces of federal food and nutrition legislation.<p>If you don't understand why anti-hunger groups hardly ever advocate for higher wages or public health nutrition measures for low-income Americans, see Andy Fisher's analysis: they owe too much to their food-company donors. <i>Big Hunger</i> is a call to action, one well worth heeding.</p>&#x2015;<b>Marion Nestle</b>, Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, New York University; author of <i>Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (and Winning)</i><br><br><p>In this groundbreaking work, Andy Fisher details America's approach to rising hunger, and lays bare a modern Orwellian irony: The big food companies whose labor practices have spurred hunger now receive credit&#x2015;tax, media, and otherwise&#x2015;for supporting charities to address it. It's an invaluable read.</p>&#x2015;<b>Tracie McMillan</b>, author of the <i>New York Times</i> Best Seller <i>The American Way of Eating</i><br><br><p><i>Big Hunger</i> is arguably the most important book on the American food scene in a decade. A decade ago, the food scene was rocked by The <i>Omnivore's Dilemma</i>. Now we must face a Charitable Dilemma.</p>&#x2015;<b>Wayne Roberts</b>, author of <i>The No-Nonsense Guide to World Food</i><br><br><p>Andy Fisher charts how the good intention to end poverty has metastasized into an industry that keeps 50 million Americans hungry. No one is spared in this searing analysis, from corporations to foundations to food banks. If hunger is to be ended in America, the unholy coalitions that currently frustrate, ignore, and try to contain attempts for radical change will need to be blown apart. <i>Big Hunger</i> is a book to burst that bubble.</p>&#x2015;<b>Raj Patel</b>, Research Professor, Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, University of Texas at Austin; author of <i>Stuffed and Starved: The Hidden Battle for the World Food System</i><br><br><p>If you are an anti-hunger activist, you should read <i>Big Hunger</i>.

In today's environment, it's crucial that teens be able to ask hard questions about how to take care of themselves, make decisions that reflect their values, and stay safe. In <em>Sex, Teens, and Everything in Between</em>, veteran teen sex educator and mother of three Shafia Zaloom helps you discuss a wide variety of sex-related topics with your teens, including:</p><ul> <li> How to get and give consent </li> <li> What it means to have "good" sex</li> <li> How to help prevent sexual harassment and assault</li> <li> How to stay safe in difficult situations</li> <li> The legal consequences of sexual harassment and assault, and what to do if a teen experiences assault or is accused of it</li> <li> Stories from survivors of sexual assault</li></ul><p>Approachable, engaging, and with real-life scenarios and discussion questions in every chapter,<em> Sex, Teens, and Everything in Between</em> is a must-have resource that gives parents and educators the tools they need to have meaningful conversations with teens about what sex can and should be. </p></p><p>"Finally! A book on adolescent sexuality by an expert who talks to teens about sex and relationships every day! Sex, Teens, &amp; Everything in Between&nbsp;provides a window into the real issues that today's adolescents face and an essential road map to help parents and youth navigate this thorny new world." - <strong><em> Julianna Deardorff, co-author of The New Puberty: How to Navigate Early</em></strong><br><br>"Sex, Teens, &amp; Everything in Between is the ultimate relationship guide for teens of all orientations and identities. Teens will find the information, tools and wisdom to support their development of personal and sexual agency. These pages are loaded with familiar scenarios, each followed by helpful perspective and a breakdown of potential choices and outcomes relating to each situation. Shafia provides readers the fuel to make the consent conversation clear, relevant and applicable for everyone, acknowledging the interconnected factors of social media, normalized hookup culture, Internet porn and gender norms." - <strong><em> Cindy Pierce, author of Sexploitation: Helping Kids Develop Healthy Sexuality in a Porn-Driven World</em></strong><br><br>"Adolescent sexuality has become more complex and the issues surrounding it more difficult than ever before. Shafia is a rational voice for parents, caregivers, and kids on this difficult and sometimes awkward topic. Sex, Teens, &amp; Everything in Between is a must read for the parent, caregiver, and educator who would like to understand the teen universe of all things sex, and pro-actively and thoughtfully engage with their teens around these challenging topics." - <strong><em> Debra Wilson, President of the Southern Association of Independent Schools</em></strong><br><br>"As a sex educator, I know that these are the real issues that teens have questions and concerns about. I really appreciate Shafia's candid discussion about teen sexuality, including many topics that they would likely be afraid to bring up with their own parents. Her book is very inclusive, and discusses perspectives and motivations that would be eye opening to parents. What a great resource to help teens navigate the sexual decisions of our modern culture and make smart choices. I wish everyone could have a Shafia as their personal counselor!" - <strong><em> Ivy Chen, Professor at San Francisco State, Department of Sociology and Sexuality Studies</em></strong><br><br>"Shafia Zaloom has created a roadmap for every teen, every parent, and every family navigating the sometimes frightening intersection of loving, healthy relationships, sex, and digital technology.&nbsp;Zaloom is a gifted educator who approaches her work with compassion, a deep knowledge of the lives of today's teens, as well as candor-and well-placed humor. She shows us that underlying&nbsp;teens' complex relationships with technology and sex are the age-old human needs for caring, connection and respect." - <strong><em> Esta Soler, President, Futures Without Violence</em></strong><br><br>"These are the conversations every parent wants to be having with their teenagers. The pages are filled with sensitive, honest and utterly urgent case studies that give us insight into the importance and delicacy of sexual consent. Shafia provides an unflinching examination of consent education - we can't afford to look away." - <strong><em> Bonni Cohen, documentary film director of Audrie &amp; Daisy (as seen on Netflix)</em></strong></p><h2>Day Light, Night Light: Where Light Comes From (Let&#39;s-Read-and-Find-Out Science 2)</h2><p>Moonlight is really sunlight!<p>Did you know that the moon doesn't make its own light?

Within a text that is somewhat repetitive, Branley offers elementary explanation of properties of light: reflective light, speed of light, and what happens inside an electric light bulb. Sunlight, candlelight, flashlight, campfire, lanterns, and stars are discussed. The mention of simple experiments, e.g., placing a white plate in a dark room, provides hands-on opportunities for very young learners.

Products ranging from cars to hamburgers offer conveniences and pleasures; but, as Peter Dauvergne makes clear, global political and economic processes displace the real costs of consumer goods into distant ecosystems, communities, and timelines, tipping into crisis people and places without the power to resist. In <i>The Shadows of Consumption</i>, Peter Dauvergne maps the costs of consumption that remain hidden in the shadows cast by globalized corporations, trade, and finance. Dauvergne traces the environmental consequences of five commodities: automobiles, gasoline, refrigerators, beef, and harp seals. In these fascinating histories we learn, for example, that American officials ignored warnings about the dangers of lead in gasoline in the 1920s; why China is now a leading producer of CFC-free refrigerators; and how activists were able to stop Canada's commercial seal hunt in the 1980s (but are unable to do so now). Dauvergne's innovative analysis allows us to see why so many efforts to manage the global environment are failing even as environmentalism is slowly strengthening. He proposes a guiding principle of &#x201c;balanced consumption&#x201d; for both consumers and corporations. We know that we can make things better by driving a high-mileage car, eating locally grown food, and buying energy-efficient appliances; but these improvements are incremental, local, and insufficient. More crucial than our individual efforts to reuse and recycle will be reforms in the global political economy to reduce the inequalities of consumption and correct the imbalance between growing economies and environmental sustainability.</p></p><p>Peter Dauvergne is Professor of International Relations at the University of British Columbia. He is the author of <i>The Shadows of Consumption: Consequences for the Global Environment</i> and <i>Eco-Business: A Big-Brand Takeover of Sustainability</i> (with Jane Lister), both published by the MIT Press.Dauvergne (<i>Paths to the Green World</i>) takes a look at five industries to see what consequences they have on local and global environments, showing the environmental spillovers from the corporate, trade, and financing chains that supply and replace consumer goods. He points out that cumulative progress is not keeping pace with the impact of rising consumption in a globalizing economy and higher environmental standards in first world countries often means transferring ecological degradation to poorer regions. The author's examinations of the ecological effects of automobiles, leaded gasoline and CFCs reveal that industries usually undermine efforts toward safety and sustainability until they find a salable substitute, thus ensuring more profits. An analysis of the harp seal hunt demonstrates that although activists saved seals from near extinction in the 1970s&#x2013;1980s, their publicity campaigns will be unlikely to make an impact in markets like Russia and China. Dauvergne proposes balanced consumption, but his solutions range from the unlikely&#x2014;that international donors... serve the interests of people and ecosystems in developing states more than the financial interests at home&#x2014;to the fanciful&#x2014;that the World Trade Organization... guide global trade with anticipatory strategies to prevent ecological shadows. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Here, William H. Schaberg presents a detailed publication history and biography of Nietzsche as author and an equally comprehensive annotated bibliography of his work. Schaberg describes how and why Nietzsche's books were written, when and by whom they were published, and how many copies were printed and sold, a story set against the background of publishing practice in nineteenth-century Germany. Schaberg establishes a genealogy of Nietzsche's works and clarifies the relationships between those works, an understanding of which is essential to any informed opinion of his philosophy.<br><br>Included for the first time in any language is an extensive account of Nietzsche's finances and his relationships with his publishers. Schaberg reveals a man who was obsessed with money, fought bitterly with his publishers, complained about his readers, and all the while continued to produce more and more books that went unread. He also reveals the influential role of Nietzsche's sister Elizabeth, who provoked disputes between Nietzsche and his publisher during her brother's lifetime and deliberately falsified information after his death.</p><p>Schaberg, an independent scholar, has written a fascinating, unique, and detailed portrait of Friedrich Nietzsche as author that vividly illuminates this extraordinary genius as a human being with endless problems and frustrations. Among the philosopher's 21 books, special attention is focused on the complex publications of The Birth of Tragedy (1872), the four-part Thus Spake Zarathustra (1883-92), and music for Hymn to Life (1887). Of particular interest is Nietzsche's intense outpouring of five final works during 1888, just prior to the onset of his insanity. Also discussed are his philological articles, early books, nine poems, and the unfinished Nachlass on the will to power. The reader learns about Nietzsche's lifelong poor health, peripatetic lifestyle, ineptness in business, and passion for secrecy, as well as relationships with friends, publishers, Richard Wagner, and sister Elizabeth. One wonders why publishers even printed his generally unsold, unread, and unappreciated books. With its extensive notes and annotated bibliography of 61 works, this much needed and very impressive contribution to recent Nietzchean scholarship is highly recommended for all philosophy collections.<br><i>H.

European Art Nouveau jewelry of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries embraced a new aesthetic characterized by sensuous forms, dramatic imagery and vivid symbolism. Many of the designers associated with the movement sought their inspiration not in traditional jewelry, but in the work of the pre-Raphaelites and Impressionists and in the arts of Japan. Rejecting the rigid naturalism typical of European decorative arts, designers such as Ren� Lalique and Henry van de Velde, and the artists of the German Jugenstil and Austrian Wiener Sezession movements, created ornaments that expressed the spirit and freedom of the era. These artists and designers adopted a free-flowing line and asymmetrical format that invigorated their work and set it apart, while their use of natural motifs and of the female form imbued their creations with energy, sensuality and dreamy mysticism. But underlying the undeniable exuberance of these works was a fin-de-sicle edginess that endows this period with inexhaustible fascination. With nearly 120 ornaments from a single private collection--the finest of its type in America--<i>Imperishable Beauty</i> features all of the major designers and jewelers from this groundbreaking era. Paintings, prints, posters and textiles fill out the presentation, making this book as rich and intoxicating as the aesthetic it portrays.</p><p>&#34;Yvonne J. Markowitz is Suzanne E.

As reports of family- or doctor-assisted suicides increase, the issue of voluntary death is occupying an increasingly prominent place in our national consciousness. From theologians, medical ethicists, and talk-show hosts to people facing the issue in their own lives, all are participants in the debate, each seeking to influence and control the discourse on suicide and euthanasia. Now, this pathbreaking study provides a stunning reappraisal of the early history of this controversial human freedom.<br>A Noble Death challenges the often unquestioning attitudes we have toward suicide and traces the evolution of these attitudes from the time of Socrates to the present day. Droge and Tabor reveal the extraordinary fact that early Christians and Jews did not absolutely condemn suicide, but instead focused on whether or not it was committed for noble reasons. In fascinating detail, the texts and traditions presented here--from Greek and Roman philosophy, to Judaism, Christianity, and the Bible itself--make clear that the decision to take one's life, or allow it to be taken, was not considered a sin but a noble choice, provided there was sufficient justification for the act.<br>"The Bible nowhere proscribes suicide," the authors write. "In fact, there are at least seven individuals in the Bible who take their own lives, and none of them is condemned for the act.... Many [have] a vague notion that the so-called Judeo-Christian tradition speaks decisively against the act of suicide, but just what that objection is, when it developed, and what came before it, are mostly not known."<br>From Socrates' insistence on the requirement of a divine sign to Seneca's emphasis on the unqualified freedom of the individual to Augustine's attempt to restrict that freedom, A Noble Death illustrates how strongly we share these early attitudes toward voluntary death. But the very attempt to find a consensus indicates how the decision to die could--and can--be a conscientious one. Intensely relevant to the contemporary debate, A Noble Death takes the reader on a challenging and instructive journey to the surprising origins of Western culture's thoughts on voluntary death.</p><p>Focusing primarily on the period from the death of Socrates to Augustine of Hippo, the authors investigate the Greek legacy: the six cases of voluntary death in the Hebrew Bible and later references to these; Josephus, Philo, and early Rabbinic ideas; early Christian ideas of martyrdom and the teachings of Greek Fathers of the Church and Tertullian. They emphasize the voluntariness of martyrdom and the great shift in Christian opinion of voluntary death occasioned by Augustine's absolute condemnation of it, except in the express instance of divine command. Droge and Tabor view their study as important background to today's death-with-dignity issues. This relevance makes the book important for the informed layperson as well as scholars, ethicists, and clergy.

The novella and nine short stories, most of them set in Zimbabwe, symbolise both home and country as the &#39;house of hunger&#39;, the place of madness and violence and despair. Marechera describes a world in which tenderness has long given way to the tactics of survival, and he does so in a style at once explosive and loaded with angry humour.</p><p>Dambudzo Marechera, the son of a lorry driver, was born in 1955 in Vengere township, Rusape Rhodesia. Marechera went to a mission boarding school, supported by scholarships. He subsequently went on to the University of Rhodesia, from which he was expelled in 1973 following a protest demonstration. A scholarship took him to the University of Oxford in 1974. During the next eight years Marechera remained in exile in England but with no fixed abode or employment. He had brushes with the police which led to detentions and imprisonment. His return to Zimbabwe in 1982 was traumatic: independent Zimbabwe was no more accommodating to him than Ian Smith&#39;s Rhodesia. He died tragically young in 1987, a victim of the AIDS virus. His collection of short stories, The House of Hunger, was published in 1978 to considerable critical acclaim. It won the prestigious Guardian Fiction Prize in 1979. This was followed in 1980 by his novel Black Sunlight (also published by Heinemann) and Mindblast in 1984 (The College Press, Harare). The Black Insider, which was written in 1978, has been published posthumously by Baobab Books in Zimbabwe.&#34;... the unforgettable, virtuoso accomplishment of African writing ... a refreshing outburst from a mighty imagination ...&#34; --Stephen Gray</p><h2>Selling the Great War: The Making of American Propaganda</h2><p><p><b>The riveting, untold story of George Creel and the Committee on Public Information -- the first and only propaganda initiative sanctioned by the U.S. government.</b></p><p>When the people of the United States were reluctant to enter World War I, maverick journalist George Creel created a committee at President Woodrow Wilson's request to sway the tide of public opinion. The Committee on Public Information monopolized every medium and avenue of communication with the goal of creating a nation of enthusiastic warriors for democracy. Forging a path that would later be studied and retread by such characters as Adolf Hitler, the Committee revolutionized the techniques of governmental persuasion, changing the course of history. </p><p><i>Selling the War</i> is the story of George Creel and the epoch-making agency he built and led. It will tell how he came to build the and how he ran it, using the emerging industries of mass advertising and public relations to convince isolationist Americans to go to war. It was a force whose effects were felt throughout the twentieth century and continue to be felt, perhaps even more strongly, today. In this compelling and original account, Alan Axelrod offers a fascinating portrait of America on the cusp of becoming a world power and how its first and most extensive propaganda machine attained unprecedented results.</p></p><p><p><b>Alan Axelrod</b> is the author of numerous books on military history, general history, American history and historically rooted business and management books, including <i>Bradley</i> and <i>Patton</i> in The Great Generals Series edited by General Wesley K. Clark, the <i>BusinessWeek</i> bestsellers <i>Patton on Leadership</i> and <i>Elizabeth I, CEO</i>, as well as a host of encyclopedias and other trade reference titles. He lives in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>In the early 20th century, propaganda had yet to acquire the sinister name it would gain by the Cold War. One of the most important episodes in understanding the relationship between propaganda and American culture is WWI. Many American were not yet ready to support the total war effort needed to defeat Germany, and President Wilson was worried about bringing the public along. Enter George Creel, a journalist and Democratic Party activist, who brought modern marketing to American politics. Appointed to the Committee on Public Information to control public opinion, Creel imbedded reporters in various governmental agencies, totally controlled information, planted stories and threatened outright censorship. Within months, Creel had an army of public speakers, hundreds of reporters and a propaganda machine unimagined in American history. While this is an important story involving a remarkable character, Axelrods (<i>Patton on Leadership</i>) shoddy research undermines the book: the author has not consulted either archival material, the vast newspaper sources or government documents. Instead, he relies too heavily on Creels writings. Nor does Axelrod place his subject in the larger sphere of either media or marketing history. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Since that time, Helen Gardner&#39;s vision has been the leader in educating students about the artistic legacy of the world. For the past 75 years, ART THROUGH THE AGES has defined the introductory art history course. The intention of this classic, in Helen Gardner&#39;s words, has been &#34;to introduce the reader to certain phases of art, architecture, painting, sculpture, and the minor arts from the remote days of the glacial age in Europe, through successive civilizations of the Near East, Europe, America, and the Orient, to the twentieth century.&#34; Now, as we begin a new millennium, we do so with the eleventh edition.

Galileo, one of whose fingers is preserved in a vessel displayed in Florence, provided much of the impetus for modern science, pointing the way out of medieval ignorance. In this brilliant account of the central ideas of contemporary science, Peter Atkins celebrates the effectiveness of Galileo's symbolic finger for revealing the nature of our universe, our world, and ourselves.<br> <em>Galileo's Finger</em> takes the reader on an extraordinary journey that embraces the ten central ideas of current science. "By a great idea," writes Peter Atkins, "I mean a simple concept of great reach, an acorn of an idea that ramifies into a great oak tree of application, a spider of an idea that can spin a great web and draw in a feast of explanation and elucidation." With wit, charm, and patience, Atkins leads the reader to an understanding of the essence of the whole of science, from evolution and the emergence of complexity, to entropy, the spring of all change in the universe; from energy, the universalization of accountancy, to symmetry, the quantification of beauty; and from cosmology, the globalization of reality, to spacetime, the arena of all action. <br> "My intention is for us to travel to the high ridges of science," Atkins tells us. "As the journey progresses and I lead you carefully to the summit of understanding, you will experience the deep joy of illumination that science alone provides."<br> <em>Galileo's Finger</em> breaks new ground in communicating science to the general reader. Here are the essential ideas of today's science, explained in magical prose.</p><p><br><strong>Peter Atkins</strong> is Professor of Chemistry and Fellow of Lincoln College at Oxford University. He is the author of several world-famous chemistry textbooks. One reason why these continue to be leaders throughout the world after more than two decades is his remarkable gift for being able to explain things--especially challenging concepts--memorably and with great clarity. This gift has regularly been deployed in his books for the general reader (Richard Dawkins has described one of them, <em>The Creation</em>, as 'the most beautifully written popular science book ever'), but never to better effect than now, in <em>Galileo's Finger</em>.<br>This beautifully written but at times overly ambitious book illustrates both the possibilities and the limitations of science popularizations. Chemistry professor Atkins examines the epochal ideas of science, including evolution, the role of DNA in heredity, entropy, the atomic structure of matter, symmetry, wave-particle duality, the expansion of the universe and the curvature of spacetime. Exploring the history of these concepts from the ancient Greeks onward, the chapters amount to case studies in the power of the Galilean paradigm of the "isolation of the essentials of a problem," and mathematical theorizing disciplined by real-world experiment, as humanity's understanding moves from armchair speculation and observational lore to testable theories of great explanatory power. Atkins presents this progress as a search for evermore fundamental abstractions: DNA emerges as the fleeting physical instantiation of immortal information; thermodynamics is a universal tendency to disorder; and much of physics itself a logical corollary of pure geometry. Writing in lucid, engaging prose illustrated with many ingenious diagrams, Atkins often succeeds brilliantly in conveying the deep conceptual foundations of scientific disciplines to readers lacking a mathematical background. He falters a little, like most science popularizers, at the frontiers of modern physics, where things get very abstract indeed. Atkins's examples are excellent and his prose a marvel of economy, but for most lay readers, no amount of graphical heuristics or arguments by analogy will fully explain string theory or four-dimensional space-time curvature. Still, the elegant style, wide-ranging scope, and unusually high ratio of enlightening explanation to baffling abstruseness make this book one of the best of its kind. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ruth Harriet Louise and Hollywood Glamour Photography</h2><p>When Ruth Harriet Louise joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the studio with "more stars than there are in heaven," she was twenty-two years old and the only woman working as a portrait photographer for the Hollywood studios. In a career that lasted from 1925 until 1930, Louise (born Ruth Goldstein) photographed all the stars, contract players, and many of the hopefuls who passed through the studio's front gates, including Greta Garbo, Lon Chaney, John Gilbert, Joan Crawford, Marion Davies, and Norma Shearer. This book, which coincides with a major traveling retrospective of Louise's work organized by the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, is the first collection of her exquisite photographs. Containing over one hundred breathtaking images--reproduced from the original negatives--it attests to the talent and vision of a surprisingly unknown photographer who formed the images and helped create the popularity of some of our most enduring stars.<br><br>Louise shot about one hundred thousand negatives that distilled the glamour, drama, and excitement of MGM's feature productions. Louise's original photographs were circulated to millions of moviegoers, magazine and newspaper readers, and fans. The movies and publicity machine that these photographs supported shaped the basic notions of stardom, glamour, and fashion in the 1920s and still affect our ideas today.<br><br>Robert Dance and Bruce Robertson re-create the entire process--from the moment a performer sat in front of Louise's camera to the point at which a fan pasted a star's picture into a scrapbook. They provide insight into Louise's work habits in the studio and describe the personal dynamics between Louise and the actors she photographed. They include a condensed account of the methods of other photographers, a sharp analysis of fan culture in the period, and superb readings of Louise's photographs. With its combination of well-known and rare images, all magnificently reproduced, this book is a fitting tribute to one of the most gifted and underappreciated glamour photographers of Hollywood's golden period.<br><br>Note: The hardcover edition of this book <b>does</b> have a dust jacket.

This book provides detailed descriptions of the structures and movements necessary for healthy and efficient body awareness, balance, breathing, phonation, resonance, articulation, and gesture. Many voice books focus on the anatomical facts, but leave singers asking, "How can I apply this to my singing?" ''What Every Singer Needs to Know About the Body'' helps to answer that question, providing practical exercises and detailed illustrations. <br> For the third edition, the authors have updated and expanded the content throughout the book. Some specific additions include: <ul> <li>Updates and extensions throughout in response to reader feedback.</li> <li>Additional recommended resources and websites for further reading.</li> <li>Audio and video recordings of the exploratory exercises available on a PluralPlus companion website.</li></ul> <br> This book provides the technical foundation for singers of all styles. The authors do not espouse a single method or attempt to teach singing techniques or styles. Rather, they describe the movements of singing with accuracy and detail so that singers may experiment on their own and communicate with each other in a common language. <br> In the words of Lynn Helding, Associate Professor of Practice in Vocal Pedagogy at the University of Southern California Thornton School of Music and author of the "Mindful Voice" column in the <i>Journal of Singing</i>: <br> <i>"What sets this book apart are the detailed exercises designed to inculcate accurate kinesthesia in singers. This facet of the book is critically important, because it is not sufficient to simply possess declarative knowledge of voice physiology. Singers must develop body sense on how to marshal all the components of the five systems of the voice (respiration, phonation, resonation, articulation and cognition) to work together to create efficient, artistic singing."</i><p><b>NOTE:</b>This book comes with supplementary content on a PluralPlus companion website.

Particularly in Black communities in the rural south, these women served vital social, cultural and political functions. It was believed that they possessed magical powers: they negotiated the barrier between life and death and were often regarded as the "knower" in a community.

It documents his four-year journey round the world by motorbike, travelling through Europe, Africa, South and North America, and Asia. A number one bestseller in the late 1970s, it is still regarded as one of the greatest motorcycle books - indeed, one of the greatest travel books - ever written.<br>In 2001, at the age of 69, Ted Simon decided to retrace his journey, and DREAMING OF JUPITER is the result. It took him two and a half years - during which time he revisited all the countries he had travelled through in the 1970s. He found much had changed, and he reflects upon the increased poverty, political upheavals, environmental issues and indeed the changes in himself.<br>But ultimately, DREAMING OF JUPITER is a hugely inspiring read with a positive message at its heart - that even at the age of 70 you can still set off on an adventure, and be surprised and excited by what life throws at you along the way.</p><p>Ted Simon was raised in London, studied chemical engineering but went to Paris where he fell into journalism.

Sara Davidson follows the three--Susie, Tasha, and Sara herself--from their first meeting in 1962, through the events that "radicalized" them in unexpected ways in the decade after the years in Berkeley. Susie navigates through the Free Speech Movement and the early women's movement in Berkeley, and Tasha enters the trendy New York art and society scene. Sara, a journalist, travels the country reporting on the stories of the sixties.<br>The private lives that Davidson reconstructs are set against the public background of the time. Figures such as Timothy Leary, Mario Savio, Tom Hayden, and Joan Baez are here, as are the many young people who sought alternatives to "the establishment" through whatever means seemed worth exploring: radical politics, meditation, drugs, group sex, or dropping out. Davidson's honest and detailed chronicle reveals the hopes, confusion, and disillusionment of a generation whose rites of passage defined one of the most contentious decades of this century.</p><p>"The book is witty, sad, incisive, and totally clean of sociological cant or the pomposities of a certain kind of generalizing journalism. . . .

According to McCumber's radial interpretation, Hegel constructs a complex ideal of how we should use certain words.

This book gives a compelling account and analysis of the process by which this has come about. At the same time it takes seriously those places where, for whatever reason, this process has not occurred, or has been reversed, and provides explanations for these developments.<br> <p>The first part of this story recounts how the cultural, political and economic power of Europe and, from the later nineteenth century North America, has provided an impetus for the adoption of whatever was at that time standard Western dress. Set against this, Robert Ross shows how the adoption of European style dress, or its rejection, has always been a political act, performed most frequently in order to claim equality with colonial masters, more often a male option, or to stress distinction from them, which women, perhaps under male duress, more frequently did.<br> </p> <p>The book takes a refreshing global perspective to its subject, with all continents and many countries being discussed. It investigates not merely the symbolic and message-bearing aspects of clothing, but also practical matters of production and, equally importantly, distribution.</p></p><p><b>Robert Ross </b>is Professor of African History at the University of Leiden."A short book, and an easy read that adds a fresh perspective to studies of global history, colonialism, economic development, military history, and the history of costume."<br> <i><b>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</b></i><br> <br> <p>"No longer viewed as inconsequential, clothing has much to tell historians. <i>Clothing</i> fits very neatly within this new historiography."<br> <i><b>Journal of Social History</b></i></p> <p>"A model work of synthesis - lucid, lively, accessible, globally informed, stuffed with rich and fascinating examples, making good use of theory and comparison, and approaching its topic from economic, political, social and cultural points of view."<br> <b>Peter Burke, <i>University of Cambridge</i></b></p> <p>"Robert Ross admirably weaves the history of dress into the broader contours of modernization and the rise and fall of western imperialism. <i>Clothing</i> offers the reader insights into the power of bodily adornment, both as a tool of western hegemony, and as a potential symbolic medium for nationalist aspirations of the colonized."<br> <b>John Mackey, <i>Birmingham University</i></b></p></p><h2>Sociological Footprints: Introductory Readings in Sociology</h2><p>This anthology of sociological studies provides a link between theoretical sociology and everyday life.

Walter Lippmann is ranked among the most influential public figures of his era, and his reputation endures as one of history's greatest journalists. In <i>Public Opinion</i>, Lippmann examines democratic theory, citizenship in a democratic society, and the role of the media in forming public perceptions, expectations, and actions.<br>"Where mass opinion dominates the government," the author observes, "there is a morbid derangement of the true functions of power. The derangement brings about the enfeeblement, verging on paralysis, of the capacity to govern. This breakdown in the constitutional order is the cause of the precipitate and catastrophic decline of Western society," he warned, adding, "It may, if it cannot be arrested and reversed, bring about the fall of the West."<br><i>Public Opinion</i> explores censorship and privacy, stereotypes, leadership, and the image of democracy. In doing so, it changed the nature of political science as a scholarly discipline, helped launch the profession of public relations, and introduced concepts that continue to play an important role in current political theory. It remains essential reading for students and others with an interest in politics, journalism, and history.</p><p>Walter Lippmann (1889-1974) was the author of many books on political thought and was widely considered America&#39;s most distinguished syndicated columnist. In addition to being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, he won two Pulitzer Prizes for his newspaper column &#34;Today and Tomorrow,&#34; which appeared in the New YorkHerald Tribune.</p><h2>Layered Curriculum: The Practical Solution for Teachers with More Than One Student in Their Classroom, Second Edition</h2><p>Finally a practical solution for juggling inclusion, diversity, learning styles, mulitple intelligneces and mind styles in the regular classroom without sacrificing standards.

Indeed, he provides a complete overview of this remarkable find, ranging from an informative, basic discussion of the origins of life and animals on earth, to a colorful description of Charles Walcott's discovery of the Burgess Shale and of the painstaking scientific work that went on there (as well as in Burgess collections held at Harvard and the Smithsonian), to an account of similar fossil finds in Greenland and in China. The heart of the book is an imaginative trip in a time machine, back to the Cambrian seas, where the reader sees first-hand the remarkable diversity of life as it existed then. And perhaps most important, Conway Morris examines the lessons to be learned from the Burgess Shale, especially as they apply to modern evolutionary thinking. In particular, he critiques the ideas of Stephen Jay Gould, whose best-selling book <em>Wonderful Life</em> drew on Conway Morris's Burgess Shale work. The author takes a fresh look at the evidence and draws quite different conclusions from Gould on the nature of evolution. <br> This finely illustrated volume takes the reader to the forefront of paleontology as it provides fresh insights into the nature of evolution and of life on earth.</p><p>The Burgess Shale deposits, in western Canada, have joined the Galapagos Islands as a destination of choice for vacationing scientists and fans of evolutionary theory. The fame of these places is in part due to the unique flora and fauna (living or dead) they boast, and in part to the scientists who have described and attempted to explain them. Like Stephen J. Gould's <i>Wonderful Life</i>, this book from Simon Conway Morris, original describer of the fascinating, troubling fossil <i>Hallucigenia</i>, gives an account of the Burgess Shale and the scientists who argue over the tiny remains of once-living creatures. Conway Morris calls the place "the most wonderful fossil deposit in the world," and his emotion is contagious. Beyond describing the creatures that formed the fossils, he speculates about how the Burgess Shale fits in to the story of human evolution.<br><strong>Simon Conway Morris</strong> is Professor of Paleontology in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge, England, and is a Fellow of the Royal Society.

This popular and widely recommended Book emerged from teaching countless courses and grading thousands of exams over many years at the New York University Law School and at the City University Law School. In building-block detail, it shows you how to practice decoding of the typical multi-issue exam essay. It enables you to add an exam lens to your learning and outlining, so that you are practicing issue-spotting and step-by-step writing of lawyerly exam arguments throughout the semester and also illustrates many blunders that constantly appear on law exams. It includes many actual exam problems with illustrative &#34;A&#34; and occasional poor answers, and detailed comments explaining why exam arguments are excellent, mediocre or poor.</p><p>I'm Professor John Delaney, the author of this Exam book as well as Learning Legal Reasoning and Learning Criminal Law As Advocacy Argument. I wrote all three books to aid in piercing the obscurity, mystification and the "hide-the-ball" teaching that is still practiced in so much of legal pedagogy. <p>Many first-year students do not know that law schools do not give college-type exams and therefore that college exam skills and LSAT skills are definitely not the skills you need to excel on law-school exams. They are also unaware that you are not systematically taught exam-taking skills in most law schools. In addition, many beginning students do not know that law exams do not flow directly from the assigned materials and classroom discussion. They are therefore surprised and in many instances dismayed when their grades are mediocre or worse. </p><p>Look at the article in the `Amapedia' section for my essay about law school exams. The "Inside the Book" section also includes Chapter One from this Exam book as well as its "Detailed Table of Contents." In addition, I have posted my responses to nine commonly asked questions about the challenging law school classroom and sixteen questions about preparing for the different and difficult law school exams in the Amapedia section of the Learning Legal Reasoning Amazon page. This Exam book helps students to learn and practice the two key skills you need to excel on these exams: issue-spotting and then the writing of succinct legal arguments to resolve each spotted issue. All three books emerge from thirty years of law school teaching at two law schools (N.Y.U. and CUNY). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>A law professor for thirty years, John Delaney taught criminal law, advanced criminal law, comparative criminal law, international criminal law, and other courses to law school students and students in masters and doctoral degree programs at the New York University School of Law. He then taught criminal law, advanced criminal law, the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, Jurisprudence and other courses at the City University of New York Law School. <p>Learning Legal Reasoning, How To Do Your Best On Law School Exams and Learning Criminal Law as Advocacy Argument emerged from these decades of teaching and reflecting on what students most need to succeed and what is lacking in law school pedagogy. Professor Delaney is also the author of law review articles and the general editor of nine other books, mostly about comparative law, in the American Series of Foreign Penal Codes. Prior to teaching, Professor Delaney conducted approximately one thousand trials and he wrote and argued more than one hundred and fifty appeals. Unlike many professors and others, John blends early intensive trial and appellate practice with thirty years of law school teaching, including writing hundreds of exams and grading thousands.

To this second edition Scully has added a new preface that raises issues of preservation and development.<b>Vincent Scully</b> is Sterling Professor Emeritus of the History of Art at Yale University.

Set in the small Massachusetts fishing town of Gloucester, <i>Good Harbor</i> is a slow-paced study of female friendship. Here Diamant can luxuriate in the development of just two principal characters: 59-year-old Kathleen Levine, a children's librarian who is undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer, and a 42-year-old romance novelist, Joyce Tabachnik, who has bought a summer retreat in Gloucester in the hope of finally writing a "serious" book. The two meet at temple after a service presided over by a newly hired female rabbi. (What joy it must have been for Diamant, who chronicled so much oppression of Hebrew women in <i>The Red Tent</i>, to casually include the presence of female clergy.) Kathleen has no real confidante aside from her husband, Buddy; Joyce is facing estrangement from both her business-minded husband, Frank, and her soccer-obsessed daughter, Nina. What the women are lacking, they find in each other. As their intimacy grows, Diamant sometimes tells us what we already know, breaking into a conversation, for example, to announce how well things are going ("They smiled at each other. They were going to be okay."). This is a moving story nonetheless--short on incident, but with carefully drawn characters and fluid, matter-of-fact prose. <i>--Regina Marler</i><b>Anita Diamant</b> is a prizewinning journalist whose work has appeared regularly in the <i>Boston Globe Magazine</i> and <i>Parenting</i> magazine.

He won the tragic prize at the City Dionysia thirteen times between ca. 499 and 458, and in his later years was probably victorious almost every time he put on a production, though Sophocles beat him at least once.</p><p>Of his total of about eighty plays, seven survive complete. The second volume contains the complete Oresteia trilogy, comprising <i>Agamemnon</i>, <i>Libation-Bearers</i>, and <i>Eumenides</i>, presenting the murder of Agamemnon by his wife, the revenge taken by their son Orestes, the pursuit of Orestes by his mother&#x2019;s avenging Furies, his trial and acquittal at Athens, Athena&#x2019;s pacification of the Furies, and the blessings they both invoke upon the Athenian people.</p></p><p><p>Alan H.

He indicates how the colonists applied the experience they gained from fighting Indians to their engagements with European powers. And what they learned from the colonial wars they translated into a political philosophy that led to independence and self-government.<br> <br> The ready involvement of the colonies in European ambitions, the success and failure of co-operation between colony and mother country, the efforts of the English colonies together, and the growing differences between them and Britain give the narrative continuity and rising excitement.<br></p></p><p><b>Howard H.

"In these violent pages all is action, intrigue, suspense, surprise--an almost endless chain of duels, murders, love affairs, unmaskings, ambushes, hairbreadth escapes, wild rides. It is all impossible and it is all magnificent."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First published in 1844, Alexandre Dumas's swashbuckling epic chronicles the adventures of D'Artagnan, a gallant young nobleman who journeys to Paris in 1625 hoping to join the ranks of musketeers guarding Louis XIII. He soon finds himself fighting alongside three <br>heroic comrades--Athos, Porthos, and Aramis--who seek to uphold the honor of the king by foiling the wicked plots of Cardinal Richelieu and the beautiful spy "Milady."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dumas will be read a hundred, nay, three hundred years on," wrote John Galsworthy. "His greatest creation is undoubtedly D'Artagnan, type at once of the fighting adventurer and of the trusty servant, whose wily blade is ever at the back of those whose hearts have neither his magnanimity nor his courage. Few, if any, characters in fiction inspire one with such belief in their <br>individual existences. . . . To one who made D'Artagnan all shall be forgiven." Clifton Fadiman agreed: "Dumas enjoyed writing his stories. . . . The pleasure he must have felt in <br>creating D'Artagnan's troubles and triumphs <br>flashes out of these pages. . . . Dumas rampaged through the history of France, inventing, changing, distorting--doing whatever was needed to produce a tale to hold the reader breathless."</p><p>Aleandre Dumas' swashbuckling epic has embroidered upon history a colorful world of swordplay, intrigue and romance which earned this classic its reputation as the most thrilling adventure novel ever written. <p>Michael York has starred in countless films, including The Three Musketeers, The Four Musketeers, Romeo and Juliet, and the two Austin Powers boxoffice hits.

Although the Commission endeavored to accommodate the views of all the participants, no set of national standards that speaks to such a diverse constituency as the legal profession can resolve each issue to the complete satisfaction of every affected party. Undoubtedly there will be those who take issue with one or another of the Rules' provisions. Indeed, such dissent from individual provisions is expected. And the Model Rules, like all model legislation, will be subject to modification at the level of local implementation.

Not only a document of profound philosophical importance in its own right, it also contributes to the understanding of Platonic dialogues that followed it, and it exhibits the foundations of the physics and ontology that Aristotle offered in his <i>Physics</i> and <i>Metaphysics </i>VII.<br><br>In this book, R.E. Allen provides a superb translation of the <i>Parmenides</i> along with a structural analysis that procedes on the assumption that formal elements, logical and dramatic, are important to its interpretation and that the argument of the <i>Parmenides</i> is aporetic, a statement of metaphysical perplexities. Allen's original translation of and commentary on the <i>Parmenides</i> were published in 1983 to great acclaim and have now been revised by the author.</p><p>"Scolnicov&#x2019;s aim is to provide a new translation of Plato&#x2019;s <i>Parmenides,</i> with a commentary designed to show that the arguments of the second half of the dialogue, the purpose of which has long been a matter of scholarly dispute, make sense as an attempt to establish the necessary logical and epistemological conditions for Plato&#x2019;s own theory of forms and participation. In particular, Scolnicov attempts to show that the otherwise bewildering concatenation of arguments and hypotheses answers to a style of argument paralleled in other dialogues. Scolnicov also argues that the dialogue is intended as a serious rebuttal of Parmenides&#x2019; monist philosophy. Scolnicov&#x2019;s thesis is thus diametrically opposed to those who think that the dialogue is intended as a successful critique of Plato&#x2019;s own theory in the light of arguments adapted from Parmenides."&#x2015;Denis O&#x2019;Brien, author of <i>Etudes sur Parm�nide; Empedocles' Cosmic Cycle: A Reconstruction from the Fragments and Secondary Sources </i><br><br>"Scolnicov&#x2019;s introduction presents a very clear account of Parmenides&#x2019; method and the contrast that Plato&#x2019;s use of hypothesis presents to it as early as the <i>Meno.</i> Scolnicov then offers a clear account of Plato&#x2019;s method and the way it establishes an idea of philosophical method in general: not a reasoning from first principles but a disclosing of the principles at the foundation of one&#x2019;s prior convictions in order to test those principles. He subsequently takes up the principle of noncontradiction in particular before tackling the questions Parmenidean philosophy might raise about the doctrine of participation. An immensely clear and interesting introduction and way into the <i>Parmenides.</i>"&#x2015;Georgia Warnke, author of <i>Justice and Interpretation: Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought </i><br><br><b>Samuel Scolnicov</b> is Associate Professor of Philosophy at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem and author of <i>Plato's Metaphysics of Education </i>(1988).</p><h2>Unnatural Causes</h2><p><p><b>Included in The Times Books of the Year 2018</b><br><b></b><br><b>'An absolutely brilliant book.

Flora Poste, orphaned at 19, chooses to live with relatives at Cold Comfort Farm in Sussex, where cows are named Feckless, Aimless, Pointless, and Graceless, and the proprietors, the dour Starkadder family, are tyrannized by Flora&#39;s mysterious aunt, who controls the household from a locked room. Flora&#39;s confident and clever management of an alarming cast of eccentrics is only half the pleasure of this novel. The other half is Gibbons&#39;s wicked sendup of romantic cliches, from the mad woman in the attic to the druidical peasants with their West Country accents and mystical herbs. Anne Massey&#39;s skillful rendering of a variety of accents will make this story more accessible to American audiences. Recommended for both literary and popular collections.</p><p>Stella Gibbons was born in London in 1902. She went to North London Collegiate School and studied journalism at University College, London. She then worked for ten years on various papers, including the Evening Standard. Her first publication was a book of poems, The Mountain Beast (1930), and her first novel, Cold Comfort Farm (1932), won the Femina Vie Heureuse Prize. Amongst her other novels are Miss Linsey and Pa (1936), Nightingale Wood (1938), Westwood (1946), Conference at Cold Comfort Farm (1949) and Beside the Pearly Water (1954). Stella Gibbons died in 1989.Narrator Anna Massey has her work cut out for her as she takes on the eccentric Starr family of Cold Comfort Farm. Massey conveys humor and even a touch of suspense. The sights, sounds, even the smells of the farm are evoked amid the minutia of Gibbons&#39;s details. The very sounds of the words have as much effect as the tale they tell. Gibbons&#39;s use of melodrama popular in the early 1900&#39;s, to tell a romantic tale while simultaneously satirizing the genre, makes Massey&#39;s job more challenging. She manages quite well. The resurrection of the farm from brooding ineffectuality to normal human activity is worth listening to over and over. D.P.D.

Butler engages Jewish philosophical positions to articulate a critique of political Zionism and its practices of illegitimate state violence, nationalism, and state-sponsored racism. At the same time, she moves beyond communitarian frameworks, including Jewish ones, that fail to arrive at a radical democratic notion of political cohabitation. Butler engages thinkers such as Edward Said, Emmanuel Levinas, Hannah Arendt, Primo Levi, Martin Buber, Walter Benjamin, and Mahmoud Darwish as she articulates a new political ethic. In her view, it is as important to dispute Israel's claim to represent the Jewish people as it is to show that a narrowly Jewish framework cannot suffice as a basis for an ultimate critique of Zionism. She promotes an ethical position in which the obligations of cohabitation do not derive from cultural sameness but from the unchosen character of social plurality. Recovering the arguments of Jewish thinkers who offered criticisms of Zionism or whose work could be used for such a purpose, Butler disputes the specific charge of anti-Semitic self-hatred often leveled against Jewish critiques of Israel. Her political ethic relies on a vision of cohabitation that thinks anew about binationalism and exposes the limits of a communitarian framework to overcome the colonial legacy of Zionism. Her own engagements with Edward Said and Mahmoud Darwish form an important point of departure and conclusion for her engagement with some key forms of thought derived in part from Jewish resources, but always in relation to the non-Jew.<br><br>Butler considers the rights of the dispossessed, the necessity of plural cohabitation, and the dangers of arbitrary state violence, showing how they can be extended to a critique of Zionism, even when that is not their explicit aim. She revisits and affirms Edward Said's late proposals for a one-state solution within the ethos of binationalism. Butler's startling suggestion: Jewish ethics not only demand a critique of Zionism, but must transcend its exclusive Jewishness in order to realize the ethical and political ideals of living together in radical democracy.</p><p><p>The provocative theorist argues for the separation of Jewishness from Zionism, engaging a number of thinkers who offer important resources for thinking about dispossession, state violence, and possibilities of cohabitation.</p>Judith Butler is Maxine Elliot Professor in the Departments of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature and the codirector of the Program of Critical Theory at the University of California, Berkeley.

Routledge is an imprint of Taylor&amp;Francis, an informa company.</p></p><p>Hyman Minsky, who died more than a decade ago, spent much of his career advancing the idea that financial systems are inherently susceptible to bouts of speculation that, if they last long enough, end in crises. At a time when many economists were coming to believe in the efficiency of markets, Mr. Minsky was considered somewhat of a radical for his stress on their tendency toward excess and upheaval. Today, his views are reverberating from New York to Hong Kong as economists and traders try to understand what&#39;s happening in the markets. ...

Taking a building block approach, the first five chapters present English grammar and the last two chapters are devoted to the police report writing process. Each chapter includes practice and review exercises that are taken from the field and assignment material that is geared to law enforcement interests. This edition features sample reports, sample forms and &#x201c;war stories&#x201d; that help students see how grammar and writing skills are used in their profession.&nbsp;</p><p>A well-written police report can often make a critical difference in the outcome of a case or settlement. Unfortunately traditional writing and grammar courses do not address the unique writing needs which are essential in a police report. For these reasons the authors of this text have combined their knowledge of English instruction and police training to develop this useful, reliable and relevant text.</p><h2>Principles of Finance with Excel: Includes CD</h2><p><em>Principles of Finance with Excel</em> is the first textbook that comprehensively integrates Excel into the teaching and practice of finance. This book provides exceptional resources to the instructor and student, combining classroom tested pedagogy with the full potential of Excel's powerful functions.<br> <br> In today's business world, computation is done almost wholly in Excel. Excel's ability to combine graphics with computation and perform complex sensitivity analysis with ease provides potent insights into financial problems. Despite this, most finance texts rely heavily on hand held calculators and ignore Excel. As a result, many students find that after they enter the professional environment, they have to relearn both finance and Excel.<br> <br> <em>Principles of Finance with Excel</em> is ideal for undergraduate courses in introductory finance or as a reference for finance professionals. A Free In Text CD for students contains electronic versions of all spreadsheets in the book. A Companion Website http://www.oup.com/us/benninga contains lecture notes, PowerPoint Slides, and a Test Bank for instructors.</p><p><br><strong>Simon Benninga</strong> is professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and at Tel Aviv University.

His books on financial modeling and valuation are now standards in the field of finance and have been translated into Japanese, Chinese, Polish, and Italian.<br><br>"You have done an excellent job. I can't find a book with the applications you've included in here and I think it's great. I have an honors degree in Economics from University of Western Ontario and sat the CFA level one exam this year. Both bodies of studies are great but I believe where they lack is in the application dept. The majority of the content that I've looked at so far from your book was covered in level one CFA but the texts never explained applications with Excel which is a huge downfall. I believe your book compliments and fits perfectly into what I've learned in theory."--Rob Lee, Trader<p></p><br>"You have transformed me, an IT person, into someone who now knows QUITE a bit about financial management, and who can now quote, debate and discuss with the best of them! I still cannot thank you enough. I could not have done this without the knowledge imparted by Principles of Finance with Excel."--Zubin Garda, <em>Deloite-Touche</em><p></p><br>"I am a Finance Division Manager at Allstate and use Excel quite a bit. It has been my experience in hiring over the past five or so years that most students today coming out of school lack skills and knowledge of Excel. Most of what I learned while in graduate school was related to the financial (i.e. banking) industry. Very little related to anything outside of that, nor were there any real life exercises in many of the books that I had. I liked your book because it showed how to use many of the features of Excel."--Charlyn Foust, <em>Allstate</em><p></p><br>"<em>Principles of Finance with Excel</em> by Simon Benninga is truly a unique and important new Excel based corporate finance text. Many students contact me after graduation and tell me how their ability to use Excel in financial modeling has opened doors to many interesting career opportunities. However, it is not simply the ability to use Excel that has opened these doors. The key is that <em>Principles of Finance with Excel</em> promotes a sound understanding of the principles of value creation and of financial decision making under uncertainty, which allows individuals to make immediate contributions to their firms."--Glen A. Larsen Jr., Finance Department, <em>Indiana University</em><p></p><br>"Finally, a 'Principles of Finance textbook' that uses the tool that our students will 'do finance with' once they graduate. In this book, Dr. Benninga pairs his authoritative treatment of finance with Excel and a thorough study of the finance basics. Excel is used, not as a black box, but rather as an implement to further understanding of the topics. Even a seasoned Finance professional can learn new tricks and gain new insights from this book."--Timo Korkeamaki, Finance Department, <em>Gonzaga University</em><p></p><br>"Microsoft Excel continues to be an absolutely critical piece of the tools and language of applied personal and corporate finance at all levels. Bankers, CFOs, investors, accountants, lawyers, entrepreneurs, and even proactive consumers need to be adept at using this platform. <em>Principles of Finance</em> <em>with Excel</em> fills a gaping hole in the market by applying an effective teaching methodology to financial applications of Excel in a self-contained text."--Alex Gould, Department of Economics, <em>Stanford University</em><p></p><br>"Professor Benninga's <em>Principles of Finance with Excel</em> masterfully integrates theory with practice. By working through learning-by-doing examples and practical applications, the reader's knowledge and understanding of both finance and Excel are enhanced. Furthermore, it accomplishes this in an engaging and entertaining manner. This book will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning finance. I highly recommend it" --Tom McCurdy, Bonham Chair in International Finance, <em>University of Toronto</em><p></p><br>"In <em>Principles of Finance with Excel</em>, Professor Benninga skillfully interweaves financial theory with applications to real-world data. Basic financial concepts are presented with unusual clarity in an intuitive manner. This book offers a nice blend of concepts and Excel applications and is easy to follow. Readers will find the exercises in the book fun and interesting, as many of my students and I have."-- Youngsoo Kim, <em>University of Regina, Canada</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Watching Porn: And Other Confessions of an Adult Entertainment Journalist</h2><p>Lynsey G. never imagined that she would ever work in porn, but at 24 years old, with a degree in English literature and an empty bank account, she found herself reviewing the film East Coast ASSault for an adult magazine in New York City. One interview later and it was official: she was a porn journalist. The job was supposed to be temporary&#x2015;just a paycheck until she could spark her legitimate writing career&#x2015;but she loved it and spent nearly a decade describing the nuances of money shots and the effectiveness of sex toys. As both a porn consumer and a porn critic, she was not quite an insider, not quite an outsider, but came to know the industry intimately.She found it so fascinating that she co-founded WHACK! Magazine. Finally, she had a platform to voice her thoughts and observations of the adult film world, as well as educate the rest of us about what really goes on behind the scenes.&nbsp;Eventually, Lynsey was thrust back into the &#x201c;real&#x201d; world, but not before realizing that one of the most diverse and nebulous&#x2015;and profitable&#x2015;industries on the planet isn&#x2019;t so quite as different from the rest of the world as she thought. Tantalizing, eye-opening, and witty, Watching Porn is a provocative book about an average girl&#x2019;s foray into the porn industry and the people who make it what it is, both in front of and behind the camera.</p><p>Lynsey G. is a writerly type who has focused primarily on the intersection of pornography, feminism, and sexuality for the past decade as a reviewer, interviewer, critic, documentary filmmaker, and blogger. Her work across multiple genres and areas of interest has appeared in publications including Glamour, Refinery29, BUST, McSweeney&#x2019;s Internet Tendency, and&nbsp;Bitch magazine.&#x201c;G. positions her book in part as cultural analysis of pornography's complicated but inextricable relationship to social movements like feminist and queer visibility . . .

Lynsey G. deconstructs the medium and its global fanfare, exploring how people enjoy, and often simultaneously deny, smut. Hers is a project laden with humor, incisive insights, and titillating, winking bawdiness. . . . [A] provocative feminist commentary.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>ForeWord Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A young, vivacious, sexually-repressed feminist gets a job watching porn. Hijinks ensue . . . Lynsey G.'s wry, informed and nonjudgmental writing about pornography, and the adult industry is a breath of fresh air, cleverly portrayed by a writer who once generated euphemisms for pneumatic breasts. Her book deals equally and fairly with the erotic, the morally challenging, and the business sides of the adult film market, inviting readers along on her adventures through slippery movies, sexy parties and society's conflicted relationship with sex on camera. Along the way, Lynsey takes a "rock hard" sledgehammer to most misinformed assumptions and biases against one of humanity's oldest art forms&#x2015;pornography.&nbsp;<em>Watching Porn</em>&nbsp;is a valuable and insightful&nbsp;contribution to our ongoing dialogue about the role that porn holds in society today, and what role we believe it should hold, in a responsible and ethical formulation of modern sexuality.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Ley, Ph.D., author of Ethical Porn for Dicks</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Lynsey G. is an intrepid explorer, boldly going where few reporters have gone with such a critical eye: deep inside the real world of commercial sex. She finds the charm in the obscene, the humor in the lurid, and makes you wonder why you were ever scared of porn in the first place.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tina Horn, host of Why Are People Into That?! podcast and author of Love Not Given Lightly</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Easily the most charmingly informative book on the porn industry, <em>Watching Porn</em>&nbsp;fills a unique literary gap in the Porn Studies canon.&nbsp;Through it, she tackles some of the current industry discussions: What is feminist porn? What are ethical considerations on set? Why is there a debate about condoms? This is a book I can refer to all the journalists and students seeking to understand this elusive and oft misunderstood film genre.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jiz Lee, performer and editor of Coming Out Like a Porn Star</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Watching Porn</em>&nbsp;is a feminist's trip down the rabbit hole through a rapidly changing, surreal wonderland. Get your girlfriends together and discuss this book over a bottle of wine.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>May Ling Su, porn performer and author, MayLingSu.com</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Lynsey offers a deeply personal and highly readable perspective of a porn fan who is critical of the genre, mixed with the insights of an industry insider.&nbsp;She documents and dissects the issues facing today&#x2019;s porn industry from a sex positive perspective, determined to look at all aspects of a complicated business without perpetuating stigma or the usual anti-porn hysteria. She contrasts her experiences of &#x2018;mainstream&#x2019; US pornography with the growth of the feminist/ethical porn industry and does a superb job of examining the diverse philosophies of fucking within this business.&nbsp;<em>Watching Porn</em>&nbsp;is a much needed view of the diversity of pornography today.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ms. Naughty, BrightDesire.com</strong></p><h2>The Literary Churchill: Author, Reader, Actor</h2><p>Title: The Literary Churchill( Author Reader Actor) Binding: Hardcover Author: JonathanRose Publisher: YaleUniversityPress</p><p><b>Jonathan Rose</b> is William R.

The hero of this novel is a composite of the many daijin (men of wealth) who spent their time in these flourishing establishments. The novel follows the hero, Yonosuke, or &#34;Man of the World,&#34; from precocious childhood to the close of his amatory career. Along the way, Saikaku exploits the full gamut of sexual indulgence, always with frankness, often with humor, and occasionally with pathos - chronicling the erotic escapades of his hero and providing vivid character sketches of the women (and sometimes men) with whom Yonosuke dallied.</p><p></p><h2>Flesh of the Gods: The Ritual Use of Hallucinogens</h2><p>For centuries, hallucinogens have been of great significance in the ideology and religious practices of primitive societies. In fact, the use of psychotropic plants to achieve states of religious ecstasy goes back almost to the beginning of human culture. Furthermore, the content of the psychedelic experience in the West today has been found to be similar to that of the religious pilgrimages of Oriental and aboriginal New World groups. But one fundamental difference overshadows all similarities: In the traditional cultures described in this collection of ten essays, the hallucinogenic &#34;trip&#34; is a means to an end--a quest for confirmation of traditional values, for unity with the tribal ancestors. In contemporary Western society, by contrast, it tends to be an end in itself and a rejection of the society&#39;s values--perhaps, it has been suggested, because Western drug-users tend to be a-cultural. Clearly, we have much to learn from an objective study of societies with long histories of sanctioned, and controlled, drug use to achieve recognized cultural objectives.</p><p>Title of interest from Waveland Press: de Rios, Visionary Vine: Hallucinogenic Healing in the Peruvian Amazon (ISBN 9780881330939).</p><h2>Henderson the Rain King</h2><p>Bellow&#39;s glorious, spirited story of an eccentric American millionaire who finds a home of sorts in deepest Africa.</p><p>Saul Bellow won the Pulitzer Prize for his novel HUMBOLDT&#x2019;S GIFT in 1975, and in 1976 was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature &#x2018;for the human understanding and subtle analysis of contemporary culture that are combined in his work.&#x2019; He is the only novelist to receive three National Book Awards, for THE ADVENTURES OF AUGIE MARCH, HERZOG, and MR. SAMMLER&#x2019;S PLANETIf this 1959 novel, one of Saul Bellow&#39;s most beloved, seems to have exceeded its shelf life, it helps to remember that much of the absurdity is intentional: Many believe the title character is a send-up of Hemingway. Joe Barrett is an excellent choice as the narrator of this tale about a rich American who journeys into remotest Africa. His gruff voice is well suited to Henderson, a physically large and garrulous man with a penchant for bombastic dialogue and philosophical ramblings. The voices Barrett gives to the African characters--notably the western-educated King Dahfu--are hardly authentic, but they&#39;re not grating, and some of the discordance can be laid at the feet of Bellow.

In the ballad, set in the icy wilds of northwestern Canada, the title character dies after asking the narrator to cremate his body rather than bury it. After placing the body in a blazing furnace, the narrator takes a last look into the fire and hears McGee urge him to close the door before the heat escapes.

However, it was not until Frank White, a young RAF pilot, persisted with next to no official support and little money that a practical jet engine was produced during the 1930s. Even then, it was not put into operational use until near the end of the Second World War. Meanwhile a rival development team had been set up in Germany, with all the resources of a large and prosperous aircraft company. The struggles, successes and failures of these early developments make a fascinating story.<br>The differences between gas-turbine, jet, rocket, ramjet and helicopter turboshaft engines are fully explained here, and their history is traced from pioneering days through to today's highly complex and powerful units, as used in the latest wide-bodied airliners and high-performance military aircraft. The purpose of the various components of gas-turbine and jet engines, and how they work, is described in language understandable to those without an engineering background, avoiding complex mathematical formulae.<br>The development and refinement of gas-turbine and jet engines has been a remarkable success story, with almost every country in the world now linked by aircraft using these propulsion systems. The past 30 years have seen a vast improvement in the performance of large passenger and cargo aircraft, which have multiplied their carrying capacity by three, had their range doubled and safety improved by roughly 30 times, whilst their noise levels have been reduced by more than 90 per cent.</p><p></p><h2>Academic Vocabulary Toolkit 2: Student Text: Mastering High-use Words for Academic Achievement (Summer School)</h2><p>Book annotation not available for this title.Title: Academic Vocabulary ToolkitAuthor: Kinsella, Kate, Dr.Publisher: Cengage LearningPublication Date: 2012/01/31Number of Pages: 218Binding Type: PAPERBACKLibrary of Congress:</p><p></p><h2>Leaving Home: The Art of Separating From Your Difficult Family</h2><p>Why, after a childhood of emotional neglect and abuse, would a man move next door to the very parents who caused him pain? And how can a woman emerge from her mother's control in order to form healthy adult relationships?<br><br>Giving up family attachments that failed to meet our needs as children, David Celani argues, is the hardest psychological task an adult can undertake. Yet the reality is that many adults re-create the most painful aspects of their early relationships with their parents in new relationships with peers and romantic partners, frustrating themselves and discouraging them from leaving their family of origin. <i>Leaving Home</i> emphasizes the life-saving benefits of separating from destructive parents and offers a viable program for personal emancipation.<br><br>Celani's program is based on Object-Relations Theory, a branch of psychoanalysis developed by Scottish analyst Ronald Fairbairn. The human personality, Fairbairn argued, is not the result of inherited (and thus immutable) instincts. Rather, the developing child builds internal relational templates that guide his future interactions with others based on the conscious and unconscious memories he internalized from his primary relationship&#x2015;the one he experienced with his parents. While a child's attachment to parents who were neglectful or even abusive is not uncommon, there is a way out. Articulate, sensitive, and replete with examples from Celani's twenty-six years of clinical practice, this book outlines the practical steps to leaving home.</p><p>Relinquishing family attachments that failed to meet childhood needs is the most difficult task individuals can undertake as they grow into adulthood. <i>Leaving Home</i> not only emphasizes the life-saving benefits of separating from toxic parents but also offers a viable program for personal emancipation. David P. Celani centers his program on Object Relations Theory, a branch of psychoanalysis developed by Scottish analyst Ronald Fairbairn. The human personality, Fairbairn argued, is not the result of inherited (and thus immutable) instincts. Rather, the developing child builds internal relational templates rooted in conscious and unconscious memories he internalized in childhood, and these guide his future interactions with others. While an attachment to neglectful or even abusive parents is not uncommon, there is a way out. Eloquent, relatable, and filled with rich examples taken from more than two decades of clinical practice, <i>Leaving Home</i> outlines the practical steps necessary to become a healthy adult.David P. Celani is a licensed psychologist who practiced for more than twenty-five years in Burlington, Vermont. In treatment, he focused on his patients' "attachment to bad objects," which manifested through their inability to separate from parents, friends, or marital partners who demeaned, criticized, or abused them. Celani now presents workshops throughout the United States on Object Relations theory. His books with Columbia University Press include <i>Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting</i> and <i>The Illusion of Love: Why the Battered Woman Returns to Her Abuser</i>.</p><h2>Computational Genome Analysis: An Introduction (Statistics for Biology &amp; Health S)</h2><p><p>This book presents the foundations of key problems in computational molecular biology and bioinformatics.

He is consultant editor of the <i>London Review of Books</i>.</p>SODOM AND GOMORRAH is the eighth in Naxos AudioBooks&#39; adaptation of REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST. In this volume, our narrator, Proust, visits the coastal resort of Balbec for a second time and observes the homosexual behavior of his acquaintances. Neville Jason makes vivid distinctions among the singular characters, such as the aging Baron de Charlus, the insouciant violinist Charles Morel and the pretentious Mme. Verdurin. But Jason is particularly skillful in portraying Proust&#39;s dramatic shift from observer to participant when he discovers his beloved Albertine&#39;s preference for women. The abridgment is excellent--the mood and progression of the text are enhanced by a marvelous selection of piano and violin music--and the reader feels not the least bit cheated out of the whole--only, perhaps, the regret in having to wait, with a Proustian longing, for the next recording in the cycle.

Accessibly written, <i>Grief as a Family Process </i>draws on many sources, such as developmental psychology, psychoanalytic and family systems theory, and cultural anthropology. It extends and integrates these approaches into a systemic developmental model that emphasizes the ways grief can enhance the emotional growth of the family system. The model presented here views grief as a natural process through which a therapist can help families live, and even grow. Using examples from a wide variety of cultural traditions, this book argues for a transformation of attachment to, instead of detachment from, the deceased family member to sustain and enhance family development.<br><br>The book focuses in turn on the bereaved adult, child, and family, bringing sociocultural perspectives on bereavement to bear on the discussion. After an overview of the systemic developmental approach, the individual grief of adults and children is viewed in systemic developmental context. The treatment course of a 36-year-old woman following the death of her husband clearly illustrates how a grieving individual can create a new sense of self through transformations in her or his inner relationship with the deceased. Chapters on bereavement in childhood emphasize the important role of grieving parents in determining the range of possibilities available to grieving children, who even more than adults need an enduring image of their dead family member in order to proceed with their still unfolding development. <br><br>The book then looks at grieving families and their shared development, using ideas from family systems theory and family development to demonstrate how shared strategies for stability are a necessary part of family adjustment to the death of a family member. Clinical vignettes illustrate family responses to grief, traditionally interpreted as pathological, reframed in a normal developmental context, including special situations such as the death of a child. Chapters on cultural and social factors in bereavement supply a cross-cultural perspective, examining how cultural beliefs can be both resources and barriers in providing support for grieving families. The final chapter outlines the approach to assessment and treatment that is implicit throughout the clinical examples in the book. The result is a clinically useful volume that also provides a new perspective on the process and outcome of grieving. <br><br>The systemic developmental model offered in this book allows practitioners from different disciplines to support grieving families as they create new sources of relational stability that will enhance ongoing development. Abundant in clinical detail, the book is indispensable to any helping professional who works with grieving families, including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, family therapists, physicians and nurses who work with dying patients and their families, hospice and patient home-care workers, clergy, and many others. The book also serves as a text in courses on bereavement, family development, family and child therapy, and child developmental psychopathology. <br></p><p>Ester R.

Here Colm T�ib�n, the author of the Man Booker Prize&#x2013;shortlisted novel <i>The Master</i>, a portrait of Henry James, brings together for the first time all the stories that James set in New York City. Written over the course of James's career and ranging from the deliciously tart comedy of the early "An International Episode" to the surreal and haunted corridors of "The Jolly Corner," and including "Washington Square", the poignant novella considered by many (though not, as it happens, by the author himself) to be one of James's finest achievements, the nine fictions gathered here reflect James's varied talents and interests as well as the deep and abiding preoccupations of his imagination. And throughout the book, as T�ib�n's fascinating introduction demonstrates, we see James struggling to make sense of a city in whose rapidly changing outlines he discerned both much that he remembered and held dear as well as everything about America and its future that he dreaded most.<br><br>Stories included:<br>The Story of a Masterpiece<br>A Most Extraordinary Case<br>Crawford's Consistency<br>An International Episode<br>The Impressions of a Cousin<br>The Jolly Corner<br>Washington Square<br>Crapy Cornelia<br>A Round of Visits</p><p>"Perhaps of all the provinces in [James&#x2019;s] realm whose contours remain shadowy and whose topography is unresolved, the city of New York is a prime example. James&#x2019;s writings about New York disclose, more than anything, an anger, quite unlike any other anger in James, at what has been lost to him, what has been done, in the name of commerce and material progress, to a place he once knew. It is not an ordinary anger at the destruction of beauty and familiarity; it is much stranger and more complex than that, and it deserves a great deal of attention." &#x2014;From the Introduction by Colm T�ib�nHenry James (1843&#x2013;1916), the younger brother of the psychologist William James and one of the greatest of American writers, was born in New York but lived for most of his life in England. Among the best known of his many stories and novels are&nbsp;<i>The Portrait of a Lady, The Turn of the Screw,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Wings of the Dove</i>. In addition to&nbsp;<i>The New York Stories of Henry James</i>, New York Review Classics has published several long-unavailable James novels:&nbsp;<i>The Other House, The Outcry,</i>&nbsp;and<i>The Ivory Tower</i>.<br><br>Colm T�ib�n is the author of five novels, including&nbsp;<i>The Story of the Night, The Blackwater Lightship,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Heather Blazing. The Master,</i>&nbsp;a novel based on the life of Henry James, was published in 2004 and shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. It also won the&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles Times</i>&nbsp;Novel of the Year Award in 2005 and the Prix du Meilleur Livre �tranger in France. Among his nonfiction works are&nbsp;<i>Bad Blood: A Walk Along the Irish Border, Homage to Barcelona, The Sign of the Cross: Travels in Catholic Europe</i>, and, most recently,<i>&nbsp;Love in a Dark Time</i>. In 2004, his first play,&nbsp;<i>Beauty in a Broken Place</i>, was produced in Dublin where he lives.</p><h2>inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity</h2><p>Imaginative. Innovative. Ingenious.

Six years ago, her book <i>The Overworked American</i> scrutinized the getting part. It focused public attention on the disappearance of leisure and the harmful effects thereof on families and society. It sparked a debate over whether Americans really work as much as we proudly claim. (If so, how to explain the audience for <i>Monday Night Football</i>?) Nevertheless, Schor can take credit for helping push Congress into passing the Family Leave Act in 1993. <p> Now she is back with a critique of our spending. Schor notes that, despite rising wealth and incomes, Americans do not feel any better off. In fact, we tell pollsters we do not have enough money to buy everything we need. And we are almost as likely to say so if we make $85,000 a year as we are if we make $35,000. Schor believes that "keeping up with the Joneses" is no longer enough for today's media-savvy office workers. We set our sights on the lifestyles of those higher up the organizational chart. We seek to emulate characters on TV. For teenagers, "enough" is the idle splendor that hardly exists outside of what MTV un-ironically calls <i>The Real World</i>. Schor offers an original and provocative analysis of why many Americans feel driven and unhappy despite our success. As an alternative, she profiles several "downshifters" who've taken up voluntary simplicity in search of a more satisfying way of life. No policy solutions suggest themselves this time, only a change of heart. <i>--Barry Mitzman</i></p>Juliet B.

It not only covers all the topics I would cover but does so with the clarity and precision that game theory demands while at the same time providing engaging applications/examples...Harrington&#39;s game theory text is indeed the &#39;unique best response&#39; for anyone who faces an adoption decision for an undergraduate game theory course.&#39; - Klaus Becker, Texas Tech University, USA &#39;This book is outstanding. It&#39;s written with humour and patience and is extremely accessible to students, while still being as rigorous as any advanced text in the area. The book is both a theorist&#39;s and a student&#39;s delight!&#39; - Thomas Jeitschko, Michigan State University, USA &#39;One advantage of [Harrington&#39;s] text over others is that it spends a lot of time turning situations into games, and makes a good amount of effort to motivate the payoffs used, while being clear that these are typically just assumptions. Determining payoffs in games is often as much art as science, and this text seems to do a better job than most of making this known.&#39; - Nick Feltovich, University of Houston, USA &#39;Harrington introduces all of the topics you would think would be in an introductory game theory text, but what makes it exceptional is the patience and care in which he spends time seeing what the theory can buy him. That is, there are very good applications to both better show how the theory works, but also to help explain many real-world situations through the lens of game theory.&#39; - Jesse Schwartz, Kennesaw State University, USA &#39;[Harrington&#39;s text] is a well-written, well-structured introductory game theory textbook appropriate for an audience consisting of undergraduates majoring in different fields.&#39; - Giacomo Bonanno, University of California, Davis, USA</p><h2>Industrial/Organizational Psychology: An Applied Approach</h2><p>Striking a balance between research, theory, and application, the 7th edition of INDUSTRIAL/ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY: AN APPLIED APPROACH helps students discover the relevance of industrial/organizational psychology in everyday life through practical application as they analyze topics such as resume writing, interview survival, job description authoring, performance appraisal, employment law, job satisfaction, work motivation, and leadership.

From 2012 to 2014, German journalist and author Malte Herwig dropped by her ateliers in Paris and New York to chat with her about life, love, and art. She shared trenchant observations, her sharp sense of humor, and over ninety years of experience, much of it in the company of men who changed the world: Picasso, Matisse, and her second husband, the famous virologist Jonas Salk, developer of the polio vaccine. Never one to stand in the shadows, Gilot engaged with ground-breaking artists and scientists on her own terms, creating from these vital interactions an artistic style all her own, translated into an enormous collection of paintings and drawings held by private collectors and public museums around the world. In her early nineties, she generously shared her hospitality and wisdom with Herwig, who started out as an interviewer but found himself drawn into the role of pupil as Gilot, whom he called a philosopher of joy,&#x201d; shared with him different ways of seeing the world.</p><p><b>Malte Herwig</b> is a German-born author, journalist, and literary critic. His articles have appeared widely in U.S., British and German publications, including <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Observer</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, and <i>Der Spiegel</i>."In history, few people have claimed the titles of artist and muse; in her life before, with, and after Picasso, Fran�oise Gilot proves herself to be both."&#x2014;Larry Gagosian, owner, Gagosian Gallery</p><h2>Tacitus: Annals XV (Latin Texts) (Latin and English Edition)</h2><p><p>This volume, aimed at the student of Latin at sixth form to undergraduate level, contains the Latin text of Tacitus' Annals Book XV, supplemented by a useful introduction and notes on the text.</p></p><p><p>Norma Miller was formerly a lecturer in Classics at Royal Holloway College, London.</p></p><h2>Centrifugal and Axial Flow Pumps: Theory, Design, and Application</h2><p>Since the first edition was published, the application of centrifugal pumps has been extended to new fields.

After laying out the basics of Plato&#x2019;s intellectual development and considering his complex relationship with Socrates, Andrew Mason offers a thematic approach to help readers navigate through an often challenging body of work.

Drawing on recent scholarship, this engaging introduction offers the ideal, up-to-date overview of a figure who remains essential reading in western history and philosophy.</p><p>&#x201c;A very good introduction to the thought of Plato, which neither presupposes any prior knowledge on the reader's part nor falls back on the easy generalizations that characterize so many introductory texts.

With intriguing portraits of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron, the novel offers a vision of the future that expresses a reaction against Romanticism, and demonstrates the failure of the imagination and of art to redeem the doomed characters.</p><p><p> Mary Shelley&#x2019;s third published novel, <em>The Last Man</em>, is a disillusioned vision of the end of civilization, set in the twenty-first century. The book offers a sweeping account of war, plague, love, and desolation. It is the sort of apocalyptic vision that was widespread at the time, though Shelley&#x2019;s treatment of the theme goes beyond the conventional; it is extraordinarily interesting and deeply moving. </p> <p> If <em>The Last Man</em> is in some sense a &#x201c;conventional&#x201d; text of the period, it is also intensely personal in its origin; Shelley refers in her journal to the last man as her alter ego, &#x201c;the last relic of a beloved race, my companions extinct before me.&#x201d; The novel thus develops out of and contributes to a network of story and idea in which fantasy, allusion, convention, and autobiography are densely interwoven. </p> <p> This new version of the first edition (1826) sets out to provide not only a thoroughly annotated text, but also contextual materials to help the reader acquire knowledge of the intellectual and literary milieu out of which the novel emerged. Appendices include material on &#x201c;the last man&#x201d; as early nineteenth-century hero, texts from the debate initiated by Malthus in 1798 about the adequacy of food supply to sustain human population, various accounts of outbreaks of plague, and Shelley&#x2019;s poems representing her feelings after the death of her husband.</p>Morton D.

Features approximately 150 new problems and 250 new solutions. Previous edition: c1998. Softcover, hardcover not yet available.</p><p><p>&nbsp;In 1977 the Mathematics Department at the University of California, Berkeley, instituted a written examination as one of the first major requirements toward the Ph.D. degree in Mathematics. Its purpose was to determine whether first-year students in the Ph.D. program had successfully mastered basic mathematics in order to continue in the program with the likelihood of success. Since its inception, the exam has become a major hurdle to overcome in the pursuit of the degree. The purpose of this book is to publicize the material and aid in the preparation for the examination during the undergraduate years. The book is a compilation of over 1,250 problems which have appeared on the preliminary exams in Berkeley over the last twenty-five years. It is an invaluable source of problems and solutions for every mathematics student who plans to enter a Ph.D. program. Students who work through this book will develop problem-solving skills in areas such as real analysis, multivariable calculus, differential equations, metric spaces, complex analysis, algebra, and linear algebra. The problems are organized by subject and ordered in an increasing level of difficulty. Tags with the exact exam year provide the opportunity to rehearse complete examinations. The appendix includes instructions on accessing electronic versions of the exams as well as a syllabus and statistics of passing scores.</p> <p>This new edition has been updated with the most recent exams, including exams given during the Fall 2003 semester.

Throughout, they rely on a careful selection of personal, formal, and legal documents to tell the story, including early travel narratives, literary writings by Susanna Moodie and Catherine Parr Trail, government reports on slavery in Canada, official letters on Irish immigration, and newspaper articles and speeches on the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867.</p><p>In this trim new edition, each document is introduced with biographical information about the creator.

The opening essay on reading primary documents will inspire students to use the critical skills needed to analyze the readings. The new section on the War of 1812 will appeal to the many undergraduates who are fascinated by this war and by military history in general. Another update that is powerful in its subtlety is the use of cursive font for chapter titles, an effective reminder for students that these documents were not originally created in the neat and tidy format readily available in this edited collection. The most important additions, though, are the biographical details of the documents' authors. This vital background will be of great use to students seeking a wider historical context for the primary sources. </p> (Sharon Jaeger, Wilfrid Laurier University)<br><br><p>The only way that one can properly teach undergraduates the story(ies) of Canada is to expose them to the sources both oral and written. This invaluable volume of documents tells many of these early histories. Thomas Thorner's third edition of <em>A Few Acres of Snow</em> is most welcome for teachers and students of Canadian history alike. The coverage is now extremely thorough, incorporating all time periods, themes, and issues including a judicious blend of political, economic, social, multicultural, immigration, and Indigenous histories.

Who were our immediate evolutionary ancestors? What features distinguish modern humans and how did these features arise? These questions have gripped the scientific community and the public since the mid-nineteenth century, when the discovery of Neanderthal Man and the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species rocked the foundations of long-held beliefs on the subject.<br>Many new findings, speculations, and reevaluations have sharpened our views of modern human origins since then. Nevertheless, the controversy continues, as the patchy fossil record and new evidence derived from genetic techniques have given rise to competing theories. Are we the result of a single uninterrupted lineage, with each distinct species of human leading directly to the next? Or, do species such as the Neanderthal represent offshoots of an evolutionary tree that died out without leaving successors? Did modern humanity arise roughly contemporaneously in different parts of the world or from a single species in a single location? And how do biological, linguistic, artistic, and technological factors distinguish Homo sapiens from near and distant relatives? At stake in the argument is nothing less than the very definition of what it means, biologically and culturally, to be human.<br>In this vividly written volume, award-winning science author Roger Lewin describes the discoveries, the intellectual clashes, and the often conflicting interpretations of evidence that have shaped the current debate on modern humanity's origin. Readers will learn of astonishing findings (the original Neanderthal bones, and provocative theories (the genetically-derived speculation that we are all the children of a single African female who lived about 200,000 years ago), as well as one preposterous hoax (the Piltdown Man). Readers will also see the evolution of the modern science of paleoanthropology, which brings molecular biology, genetics, population biology, linguistics, and other disciplines into the search for the distinctive stamp of Homo sapiens in artifacts and skeletal remains.</p><p></p><h2>Handbook of Theories of Aging</h2><p><p> This state-of-the-art handbook will keep researchers and practitioners in gerontology abreast of the newest theories and models of aging. With virtually all new contributors and content, this edition contains 35 chapters by the most highly respected luminaries in the field. It addresses theories and concepts built on cumulative knowledge in four disciplinary areas&#x221a;&#x2265;biology, psychology, social sciences, and policy and practice&#x221a;&#x2265;as well as landmark advances in trans-disciplinary science. With its explicit focus on theory, the handbook is unique in providing essential knowledge about primary explanations for aging, spanning from cells to societies. </p> <p> The chapters in the third edition place a strong emphasis on the future of theory development, assessing the current state of theories and providing a roadmap for how theory can shape research, and vice versa, in years to come. Many chapters also address connections between theories and policy or practice. Each set of authors has been asked to consider how theories in their area address matters of diversity and inequalities in aging, and how theories might be revised or tested with these matters in mind. The third edition also contains a new section, "Standing on the Shoulders of Giants," which includes personal essays by senior gerontologists who share their perspectives on the history of ideas in their fields, and on their experiences with the process and prospects of developing good theory. </p> <p> <b>Hallmarks of the Third Edition:</b> </p> <p> <b> </b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> Highlights important gains in trans-disciplinary theories of aging </p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p> Emphasizes the future of theory development </p> </li> <li> <p> Provides insights on theory development from living legends in gerontology </p> </li> <li> <p> Examines what human diversity and inequality mean for aging theories </p> </li> <li> <p> Emphasizes interconnections between theory, research, intervention, and policy </p> </li> <li> <p> Underscores international issues with greater representation of international authors </p> </li> <li> <p> Includes section introductions by the editors and associate editors that summarize theoretical developments </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b> </b> </p> <p> <b>Key Features:</b> </p> <p> <b> </b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> Highlights variability and diversity in aging processes, from the cellular level of biological aging to the societal level of public policy </p> </li> <li> <p> Provides insights on theory development from living legends in gerontology </p> </li> <li> <p> Offers intergenerational, interdisciplinary, and international perspectives </p> </li> <li> <p> Disseminates a forward-thinking, future-oriented focus in theory development </p> </li> </ul></p><p><p><b>Vern L.

Each chapter is predicated on the desirability of replacing the dominant school of positive law and its majoritarian legitimating principle with a commitment to natural law doctrines. Part I discusses the history of natural law philosophy, and Part II deals with thematic topics related to natural law. Part III focuses on the applications and importance of natural law to certain areas of legal practice. McLean is affiliated with the department of political science at Wabash College. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>&#34;Although Americans have been nearly shamed out of their common sense and scarcely understand themselves any more, a dim feeling has begun to take root that the situation is unendurable. This book, then, appears at just the right moment, explaining afresh the grounds of those moral judgments that no one can really help making yet so many feel they have to deny. I wonder how the editor has managed to get his distinguished collection of scholars to write so clearly; most books on the natural law couch their appeals to the sense of plain people in language that even graduate students find difficult to understand. Besides being nearly free of that vice, the anthology possesses a virtue one seeks in all such books but rarely finds: it tells what natural law has to do with the law as actually practiced.&#34;-J.

Schlesinger Jr. (1917&#x2013;2007), known today as the architect of John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s presidential legacy, blazed an extraordinary path from Harvard University to wartime London to the West Wing. The son of a pioneering historian&#x2015;and a two-time Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winner in his own right&#x2015;Schlesinger redefined the art of presidential biography. <em>A Thousand Days</em>, his best-selling and immensely influential record of the Kennedy administration, cemented Schlesinger&#x2019;s place as one of the nation&#x2019;s greatest political image makers and a key figure of the American intellectual elite&#x2015;a peer and contemporary of Reinhold Niebuhr, Isaiah Berlin, and Adlai Stevenson.</p><p>The first major biography of this defining figure in Kennedy&#x2019;s Camelot, <em>Schlesinger: The Imperial Historian</em> presents a dramatic life and career set against the backdrop of the American Century. Biographer Richard Aldous draws on oral history, rarely seen archival documents, and the official Schlesinger papers to craft a portrait of the incandescently brilliant and controversial historian who framed America&#x2019;s ascent to global empire.</p> 8 pages of illustrations</p><p>Richard Aldous is a professor of history at Bard College, where he holds the Eugene Meyer Chair. He is the author and editor of eleven books and is a contributor to television and radio on both sides of the Atlantic.

He lives in Red Hook, New York.&#x201c;[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.] has found in Aldous an agreeably judicious biographer. ...

Banner, Jr., <em>The Weekly Standard</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The triumph of Richard Aldous&#x2019;s new book is that it separates the myth from the reality, explaining both the seemingly inexorable rise of Schlesinger and how he contributed so much to the subsequent mythologising of the Kennedy era.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Irish Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Richard Aldous&#x2019;s <em>Schlesinger</em> is a deeply researched and skillfully written biography of a brilliant, scheming, perceptive and highly-partisan figure who believed in writing &#x201c;useful history&#x201d; to promote liberal causes and hoped to affect history by his own participation in American politics.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Curtis Wilkie, author of <em>The Fall of the House of Zeus</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In this elegant biography, Richard Aldous reveals the fascinating story of the &#x2018;knee-pants genius&#x2019; who won his first Pulitzer Prize at the age of twenty-eight and went on to become the Kennedys&#x2019; court historian.

Kuli, the only known cat who surfs, is "Adventurous." "Hardworking" Nudge saved her owners from a house fire. "Caring" furball Monty monitors his owner for signs of a drop in blood sugar and has saved her from going into a diabetic coma more than once. These are just a few of the inspiring tales in this pocket-size tome. Each section also includes tidbits, "Just for Fun Facts," and additional information on how to care for felines.

The stories of these communities offer a way of examining the complex historical forces shaping people's lives at various moments in our past. The debates and conflicts surrounding the most momentous issues in our national life&#x2014;independence, emerging democracy, slavery, westward settlement, imperial expansion, economic depression, war, technological change&#x2014;were largely worked out in the context of local communities. Through communities we focus on the persistent tensions between everyday life and those larger decisions and events that continually reshape the circumstances of local life. Each chapter opens with a description of a representative community. Some of these portraits feature American communities struggling with one another: African slaves and English masters on the rice plantations of colonial Georgia, or Tejanos and Americans during the Texas war of independence. Other chapters feature portraits of communities facing social change: the feminists of Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848, or the African Americans of Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955. As the story unfolds we find communities growing to include ever larger groups of Americans: the soldiers from every colony who forged the Continental Army into a patriotic national force at Valley Forge during the American Revolution, or the moviegoers who aspired to a collective dream of material prosperity and upward mobility during the 1920s. </p> <p> We prepared this brief edition to serve the needs of one-semester courses, teachers who assign supplemental readings, or anyone interested in a more condensed narrative of American history. While this volume is about two-thirds the length of the full-length version, it retains the distinct point of view that makes it unique among all college-level American history texts. The community focus remains fully in place as the integrating perspective that allows us to combine political, social, and cultural history. </p> <p> <i>Out of Many</i> is also the only American history text with a truly continental perspective. With community vignettes from New England to the South, the Midwest to the far West, we encourage students to appreciate the great expanse of our nation. For example, a vignette of seventeenth-century Sante F�, New Mexico, illustrates the founding of the first European settlements in the New World. We present territorial expansion into the American West from the viewpoint of the Mandan villagers of the upper Missouri River of North Dakota., We introduce the policies of the Reconstruction era through the experience of African Americans in Hale' County, Alabama. A continental perspective drives home to students that American history has never been the preserve of any particular region. </p> <p> In these ways <i>Out of Many</i> breaks new ground, but without compromising its coverage of the traditional turning points that we believe are critically important to an understanding of the American past. Among these watershed events are the Revolution and the struggle over the Constitution, the Civil War and Reconstruction, and the Great Depression and World War II. In <i>Out of Many,</i> however, we seek to integrate the narrative of national history with the story of the nation's many diverse communities. The Revolutionary and Constitutional period tested the ability of local communities to forge a new unity, and success depended on their ability to build a nation without compromising local identity. The Civil War and Reconstruction formed a second great test of the balance between the national ideas of the Revolution and the power of local and sectional communities. The Depression and the New Deal demonstrated the importance of local communities and the growing power of national institutions during the greatest economic challenge in our history. <i>Out of Many</i> also looks back in a new and comprehensive way&#x2014;from the vantage point of the beginning of a new century and the end of the cold war&#x2014;at the salient events of the last fifty years and their impact on American communities. The community focus of <i>Out of Many</i> weaves the stories of the people and the nation into a single compelling narrative. </p> <p> <i>Out of Many,</i> brief fourth edition; includes expanded coverage of our diverse heritage. Our country is appropriately known as "a nation of immigrants," and the history of immigration to America, from the seventeenth to the twenty-first centuries, is fully integrated into the text. There is sustained and close attention to our place in the world, with special emphasis on our relations with the nations of the Western Hemisphere, especially our near neighbors, Canada and Mexico. In a completely new final chapter we consider the promises and the risks of American diversity in the new century. The statistical data has been completely updated with the results of the 2000 census. We have also incorporated new scholarship on the South, popular culture, science and technology, and the Cold War. </p> <p> The brief fourth edition also includes an important new feature, Community &amp; Memory, in which we examine the way American communities have attempted to commemorate and memorialize the past. Communities sometimes come to blows over different ways of looking at history. Arguments over the meaning of the past are not confined to the classroom. </p> <p><b>SPECIAL FEATURES</b></p> <p> With each edition of <i>Out of Many</i> we have sought to strengthen its unique integration of the best of traditional American history with its innovative community-based focus and strong continental perspective. A wealth of special features and pedagogical aids reinforces our narrative and helps students grasp key issues. </p> <ul> <li><b>Community and Diversity.</b> <i>Out of Many,</i> brief fourth edition, opens with an introduction, titled "Community and Diversity," that acquaints students with the major themes of the book, providing them with a framework for understanding American history.</li> <br><br> <li><b>Community &amp; Memory.</b> New to the brief fourth edition, this special illustrated feature, located at the end of Chapters 1, 4, 6, 9, 14, 19, 21, 25, 28, and 31, examines the ways in which American communities have attempted to commemorate the past and the conflicts that arise when the meaning of the past divides the members of a community.

It will include novels, poetry, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction. The series will be extensive and open-ended and will provide school students with a range of edited texts taken from a wide geographical spread.Embittered by a false accusation, disappointed in friendship and love, the weaver Silas Marner retreats into a long twilight life alone with his loom. . . and his gold. Silas hoards a treasure that kills his spirit until fate steals it from him and replaces it with a golden-haired founding child. Where she came from, who her parents were, and who really stole the gold are the secrets that permeate this moving tale of guilt and innocence. A moral allegory of the redemptive power of love, it is also a finely drawn picture of early nineteenth-century England in the days when spinning wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses, and of a simple way of life that was soon to disappear.<p></p><p>"I think <i>Silas Marner</i> holds a higher place than any of the author's works. It is more nearly a masterpiece; it has more of that simple, rounded, consummate aspect. . .which marks a classical work." -- Henry James</p></p><h2>The Elusive Quest for Growth : Economists&#39; Adventures and Misadventures in the Tropics</h2><p>Since the end of World War II, economists have tried to figure out how poor countries in the tropics could attain standards of living approaching those of countries in Europe and North America. Attempted remedies have included providing foreign aid, investing in machines, fostering education, controlling population growth, and making aid loans as well as forgiving those loans on condition of reforms. None of these solutions has delivered as promised. The problem is not the failure of economics, William Easterly argues, but the failure to apply economic principles to practical policy work.<br> <br> In this book Easterly shows how these solutions all violate the basic principle of economics, that people&#x2014;private individuals and businesses, government officials, even aid donors&#x2014;respond to incentives. Easterly first discusses the importance of growth. He then analyzes the development solutions that have failed. Finally, he suggests alternative approaches to the problem. Written in an accessible, at times irreverent, style, Easterly's book combines modern growth theory with anecdotes from his fieldwork for the World Bank.</p><p>William Easterly is the author of <i>The Elusive Quest for Growth: Economists' Adventures and Misadventures in the Tropics</i> (MIT Press, 2001) and <i>The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good.</i> He is Professor of Economics at New York University (Joint with Africa House), Codirector of NYU's Development Research Institute, visiting Fellow at the Brookings Institution, and Nonresident Fellow of the Center for Global Development in Washington, DC."A highly readable and iconoclastic treatment of the determinants of economic growth."<br> &#x2014; <b>Richard N.

It encourages and facilitates active and self-directed learning by the students so that instructors can teach more effectively and efficiently. The manual emphasizes dissection procedures that preserve as many structures as possible for later review of the entire specimens. This approach is an excellent preparation for students who will subsequently take anatomy courses in the health and animal sciences. Moreover, this manual places the observed material into an evolutionary and functional context. Students will understand the biological role, physiology, and embryonic development of each organ system and its parts, and how the various organ systems have evolved over time and in different animals. Organized by organ systems, this text brings the anatomy alive for students by interspersing narrative text throughout and explaining how the shape and structure of an organ relates to its function, and how evolutionary processes have transformed the form and function of organs. Additionally, the authors introduce a new feature, Anatomy in Action boxes, which contain interesting supplemental material that provides a broader context. Some of these boxes relate to functional anatomy, some make comparisons between different animals, and some address general biological questions that may include comparisons to the anatomy and biology of human beings.</p><p>Dominique G.

Because of his ardent Puritan beliefs and natural talent for government and politics, he was appointed governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony. He became the foremost political leader in the colony for nearly 20 years, including twelve nonconsecutive terms as governor. When Winthrop and these new settlers arrived in the New World, they were aiming to create their own utopia, but they encountered difficulty and dissent. <p>In The Puritan Dilemma: John Winthrop, biographer Edmund Morgan helps us understand the motivations behind Puritan migration to America and the ideological and political difficulties they faced once they arrived. What does freedom mean? What is the proper role of the individual in society? Alongside the unfolding drama of a developing country, Morgan explores the life of John Winthrop and the core question of what level of responsibility people owe to their community and society.</p></p><p></p><h2>A Troublesome Subject: The Art of Robert Arneson</h2><p>The first major book to consider the life and work of Robert Arneson, <i>A Troublesome Subject</i> tells the fascinating story of how a high school art teacher transformed himself into an artist of international stature and ambition. Representing the full scope of Arneson&#x2019;s career in a rich survey of color reproductions, this book is at once a study of the trajectory of contemporary culture, the work of Robert Arneson, and the relationship between the two. It shows how Arneson&#x2019;s work articulated the crisis of narcissism that has defined American culture since 1970. Jonathan Fineberg develops his ongoing work toward a psychosocial history of art as he proceeds through Arneson&#x2019;s career&#x2015;chronicling his early life, the formation of a personal style, and finding a unique subject matter in his famous post-1970 turn to self-portraiture.</p><p>"I went to Davis and I began spending time in TB9.

You can use any Bible translation you choose. The materials were created to be used by churches of any traditional Christian denomination.

We do skip around a little with the historical books, because there's some repetition in theScripture itself. (We didn't want to confuse kids by covering the life of King David, going on to the other kings, then coming back to David again.)&nbsp;There are some fun gamesand crafts and puzzles, at least one a week.

But how do games create emotion? In<i> How Games Move Us</i>, Katherine Isbister takes the reader on a timely and novel exploration of the design techniques that evoke strong emotions for players. She counters arguments that games are creating a generation of isolated, emotionally numb, antisocial loners. Games, Isbister shows us, can actually play a powerful role in creating empathy and other strong, positive emotional experiences; they reveal these qualities over time, through the act of playing. She offers a nuanced, systematic examination of exactly how games can influence emotion and social connection, with examples&#x2015;drawn from popular, indie, and art games&#x2015;that unpack the gamer's experience.</p><p>Isbister describes choice and flow, two qualities that distinguish games from other media, and explains how game developers build upon these qualities using avatars, non-player characters, and character customization, in both solo and social play. She shows how designers use physical movement to enhance players' emotional experience, and examines long-distance networked play. She illustrates the use of these design methods with examples that range from Sony's <i>Little Big Planet</i> to the much-praised indie game <i>Journey </i>to art games like Brenda Romero's <i>Train</i>. </p><p>Isbister's analysis shows us a new way to think about games, helping us appreciate them as an innovative and powerful medium for doing what film, literature, and other creative media do: helping us to understand ourselves and what it means to be human.</p></p><p>Katherine Isbister is Professor of Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and is the author of<i> Better Game Characters by Design</i>.

This book is about how designers take the human desire and capacity for feeling and turn all that into meaningful interactions with computers and, via computers, with other humans.

For there is no separation between Ayn Rand the vibrant, creative woman and Ayn Rand the intellectual dynamo, the rational thinker, who was also a passionately committed champion of individual freedom.<br><p>These remarkable letters begin in 1926, with a note from the twenty-year-old Ayn Rand, newly arrived in Chicago from Soviet Russia, an impoverished unknown determined to realize the promise of the land of opportunity. They move through her struggles and successes as a screenwriter, a playwright, and a novelist, her sensational triumph as the author of <b>The Fountainhead</b> and <b>Atlas Shrugged</b>, and her eminence as founder and shaper of Objectivism, one of the most challenging philosophies of our time. They are written to such famed contemporaries as <b>Cecil B. DeMille, Frank Lloyd Wright, H.L. Mencken, Alexander Kerensky, Barry Goldwater</b> and <b>Mickey Spillane</b></p><p>There are letters to philosophers, priests, publishers, and political columnists; to her beloved husband, <b>Frank O' Connor</b>; and to her intimate circle of friends and her growing legion of followers. Her letters range in tone from warm affection to icy fury, and in content from telling commentaries on the events of the day to unforgettably eloquent statements of her philosophical ideas. They are presented chronologically, with explanatory notes by <b>Michael S. Berliner</b>, who identifies the recipients of the letters and provides relevant background and context. Here is a chronicle that captures the inspiring drama of a towering literary genius and seminal thinker, and--often day-by-day--her amazing life.</p></p><p>Born February 2, 1905, <b>Ayn Rand</b> published her first novel, <i>We the Living</i>, in 1936. <i>Anthem</i> followed in 1938. It was with the publication of <i>The Fountainhead</i> (1943) and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> (1957) that she achieved her spectacular success. Rand&#x2019;s unique philosophy, Objectivism, has gained a worldwide audience. The fundamentals of her philosophy are put forth in three nonfiction books, <i>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</i>, <i>The Virtues of Selfishness</i>, and <i>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</i>. They are all available in Signet editions, as is the magnificent statement of her artistic credo, <i>The Romantic Manifesto</i>.Novelist, screenwriter, philosopher and staunch advocate of laissez-faire capitalism, Ayn Rand (1905-1982) saw communism, Nazism and fascism as kindred evils sprung from the same collectivist mentality. Her atheist philosophy, which she called objectivism and which was reflected in her bestselling novels?The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged?extolled individualism, voluntary cooperation and conscious choice while condemning altruism (living for others) and self-sacrifice as moral fallacies. These themes resound in her outspoken, sometimes strident correspondence, which includes letters to Senator Barry Goldwater, Frank Lloyd Wright, H.L. Mencken, Dashiell Hammett, Cecil B. DeMille and actors Robert Stack and Barbara Stanwyck. Sprinkled with critiques of liberals, leftists and others whom she saw as corrupted by collectivist thinking, the voluminous correspondence reflects Rand's desperate concern for her parents and sisters, trapped under Stalinism in her native Russia (which she left for Hollywood in 1926), and includes her analyses of her novels' plots as well as pessimistic cultural commentary on an America she considered to be in decline. Berliner is executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Carmen and Other Stories (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>One of the earliest exponents of the short story, Prosper M�rim�e wrote the universally-acclaimed tale <em>Carmen</em>, which provided the basis for one of the world's most popular operas.

Through two successful editions, it has established itself as a modern cookbook classic&#x2014;and an essential reference for every serious cook.</p> <p>James Peterson trained as a chef in France, and the book offers a thorough grounding in the art of classical French sauce making, from velout�, b�chamel, and demi-glace to hollandaise, mayonnaise, and cr�me anglaise. But Peterson also presents a wide variety of lighter contemporary sauces&#x2014;including pan sauces, pur�es, and vinaigrettes&#x2014;as well as sauces from around the world, including salsas, pasta sauces, and Asian-style dipping and curry sauces. Best of all, he includes recipes not just for sauces, but for finished dishes. These recipes give Sauces a broader scope, showing how good cooking and sauce making are intimately related&#x2014;and demonstrating how a correctly prepared sauce can transform a well-cooked dish into something truly sublime.</p> <p>Now, with this new edition, Peterson has thoroughly revised and expanded <em>Sauces </em>to make it even more indispensable. You'll find more than sixty all-new recipes for dishes that showcase the leading role of sauces in cooking, such as Chicken Tagine with Harissa Sauce, Osso Buco with Julienned Vegetables, Lobster � la Nage, and Gold-Plated Chicken with Ginger, Saffron, and Almonds. There are intriguing historical recipes from medieval and seventeenth-century Europe as well as broth-based classics such as Pot au Feu and Bollito Misto. And, by popular request, Peterson at last includes a recipe for traditional American Roast Turkey with Giblet Gravy.</p> <p>This new edition has been completely redesigned to make it easier to use and includes more than thirty beautiful new color photographs of finished dishes with sauces. If you're a fan of the book's previous editions, you should note that Peterson has not cut any recipes for this edition, and that he has reinstated the popular sauce charts that appeared in the first edition.</p> <p>Lively, erudite, and authoritative, <em>Sauces </em>remains the definitive modern work on the subject. And with this edition's additional recipes&#x2014;there are now a total of 440&#x2014;it is now even more valuable as a general cookbook. You'll find all the techniques and know-how you need to master the art of sauce making, and you'll also discover how sauces can take your cooking to a whole new level. <br></p> <p><strong>Exclusive Recipe Excerpts from <em>Sauces: Classical and Contemporary Sauce Making</em></strong> </p><br><br><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br> B�arnaise and Hollandaise<br></td> <td> <br> Coq Au Vin </td> <td> <br> Pear-Butterscotch Sauce </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <p></p><p>Winner of the James Beard Foundation Award for Cookbook of the Year for the 1991 First Edition</p><p>"It's the single contemporary reference on the subject that is both comprehensive and comprehensible.

In the 70s, it was often repeated that terrorists "want a lot of people watching, not a lot of people dead"; today, it is more accurate to say that terrorists want a lot of people dead, and even more people crippled by fear and grief. A major strategic intent of modern terrorists is to use larger scale physical attacks to cause stress in the general population. These changes in terrorist strategy have made it clear that we need better psychological and social responses to terrorism and man-made disasters. The psychological science needed to provide proper and effective treatment for victims of horrendous events, such as September 11th, and future potential terrorist acts, simply does not exist, so military, medical, and psychological experts must work together to improve their understanding of mass casualty terrorism.<br><br>In <em>Psychology of Terrorism</em> leading national and international experts present the first results of this effort, including the newest findings on treatment of and clinical responses to terrorism along with their respective underlying theories. They address the history of terrorism; types and effects of weapons of mass destruction or disruption; the role of the military, government agencies, and volunteer groups in responding to terrorist threats; psychological consequences of terrorism; and treatment of special populations such as children and older adults.<br><br>This volume will be an ideal text for both academic and professional courses as well as a comprehensive resource for mental health clinicians and researchers, medical care providers, educators, public health specialists, government employees, police and fire departments, and non-profit agencies that provide services and craft policy.<br></p><p>Bruce Bongar is at Stanford University School of Medicine.

Inspired by the forward-thinking pedagogical ideas of philosopher John Dewey, the experimental, interdisciplinary college combined the ideas of radical European modernism with the philosophy of American pragmatism and teaching methods designed to encourage personal initiative as well as the social competence of the individual. Visual arts, economics, physics, dance, architecture and music were all taught on an equal footing, and teachers and students lived together in a democratically organized community. The second director of the school was Josef Albers, and John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Buckminster Fuller, Walter Gropius, Franz Kline and Charles Olson were among its teachers. As a result, the college played a foundational role in the development of a range of avant-garde practices, and exerted an enormous influence on the development of the arts in the second half of the 20th century.<br>Briefly out of print and quickly becoming a sought-after book, this gloriously designed and illustrated volume was first published for the exhibition <i>An Interdisciplinary Experiment, 1933&#x2013;1957</i>, held at the Nationalgalerie im Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin. It remains unrivaled for its sympathetic design and fulsome documentation. A profusion of archival materials&#x2015;including photographs of classes in progress and college housing with its Albers-designed furniture, and page spreads from college bulletins and issues of Robert Creeley's <i>Black Mountain Review</i>&#x2015;is presented alongside contemporary essays.

His writings&#x2015;mosaics incorporating philosophy, literary criticism, Marxist analysis, and a syncretistic theology&#x2015;defy simple categorization. And his mobile, often improvised existence has proven irresistible to mythologizers. His writing career moved from the brilliant esotericism of his early writings through his emergence as a central voice in Weimar culture and on to the exile years, with its pioneering studies of modern media and the rise of urban commodity capitalism in Paris. That career was played out amid some of the most catastrophic decades of modern European history: the horror of the First World War, the turbulence of the Weimar Republic, and the lengthening shadow of fascism. Now, a major new biography from two of the world's foremost Benjamin scholars reaches beyond the mosaic and the mythical to present this intriguing figure in full.</p><p>Howard Eiland and Michael Jennings make available for the first time a rich store of information which augments and corrects the record of an extraordinary life. They offer a comprehensive portrait of Benjamin and his times as well as extensive commentaries on his major works, including "The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility," the essays on Baudelaire, and the great study of the German <i>Trauerspiel</i>. Sure to become the standard reference biography of this seminal thinker,<i> Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life</i> will prove a source of inexhaustible interest for Benjamin scholars and novices alike.</p></p><p><p>Howard Eiland is an editor and translator of Benjamin&#x2019;s writings.</p><p>Michael W. Jennings is Class of 1900 Professor of Modern Languages at Princeton University.</p>&#x201c;[An] outstanding and monumental biography of Walter Benjamin... In the thoroughness of their account and the acuity and delicacy of their philosophical analyses, Howard Eiland and Michael Jennings have provided an indispensable sighting of Benjamin&#x2019;s achievement.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anthony Phelan</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[This] is a careful synthesis of all the available sources for Benjamin&#x2019;s life&#x2015;letters, diaries, reminiscences of friends&#x2015;with all of his major writings, to produce the comprehensive account that has been sorely lacking until now... <i>Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life</i> makes clear how intimately Benjamin&#x2019;s biography was shaped by the history of Europe during his lifetime.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Adam Kirsch</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In their superb new biography, Howard Eiland and Michael W. Jennings have given us a portrait of this elusive but paradigmatic thinker that deserves to be ranked among the few truly indispensable intellectual biographies of the modern era. I am tempted to call it a masterpiece. Nearly seven hundred pages in length, this is not only a study of Benjamin&#x2019;s life, it is also a guide to the bewildering mix of themes and preoccupations that populated this most prolific and unfamiliar of minds... To write the biography of an intellectual is difficult business, since so much of what passes for an event is taking place only in the mind or on the page&#x2015;but those are the events that really matter. Eiland and Jennings move with deliberation through Benjamin&#x2019;s major works, expounding and explaining with uncommon lucidity even when the text in question is one of notorious difficulty. The result is not a mere chronicle of a life but also a reliable map into Benjamin&#x2019;s intellectual labyrinth.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter E. Gordon</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Republic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The most comprehensive biography we are ever likely to have of Benjamin... Both authors have spent close to a lifetime on the subject. The devotion and care evident in their account are clearly based on sympathy and admiration. Their exposition of Benjamin&#x2019;s thought is exemplary, their sleuthing about his personal life breathtaking. Definitive is an archaic and much abused term that Benjamin would have abhorred; suffice it to say that it is unlikely that anyone will ever be able to tell us more about this German-Jewish thinker or present that knowledge with greater stylistic aplomb.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Modris Eksteins</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Eiland and Jennings] argue compellingly that as a critic [Benjamin] not only reshaped our understanding of many important writers, but he recognized the potentials and hazards of technological media that revolutionized culture during his lifetime... An impressive work of exegesis... Indispensable.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stuart Jeffries</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Serious and imposing, it seeks to gather up and bind the threads of Benjamin&#x2019;s career, unite the unpublished and the half-finished essays and book projects, weaving together a comprehensive biography both of the man and his thought. A great strength of <i>Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life</i> is how it lays out Benjamin&#x2019;s major works as part of an evolution of thought, providing not only invaluable context to each piece, but tracing each work&#x2019;s central claims in a lucid and approachable manner. One need not be a PhD to approach this book, and it will intrigue anyone with a passing interest in the intellectual history of the 20th century. With key essays and books given substantive contextualization and explanation, Eiland and Jennings make Benjamin&#x2019;s work accessible and networked into a larger set of themes and concerns... As omnipresent as [Benjamin&#x2019;s] tragic fate is throughout the book, Eiland and Jennings also provide a host of surprising (and even delightful) details of Benjamin&#x2019;s life, which round out the melancholic caricature of him in favor of a complex, conflicted individual.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Colin Dickey</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Impressive... [Eiland and Jennings] portray their subject as a kind of ragpicker in the neglected alleyways of a culture in transition&#x2015;a specialist in the marginal and mundane, the fragmentary and forgotten... They succeed in offering not only the most comprehensive biography to date, but a <i>tour de force</i> introduction to an incomparably incandescent mind.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Benjamin Balint</b><b>, </b><b><i>Books &amp; Ideas</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Howard Eiland and Michael W. Jennings have rightly sought and successfully produced the thread that gives a biography of Benjamin the kind of weight and significance his influence deserves... Their curiosity in searching out an expanded wealth of details now available about Benjamin, both personal and intellectual, historical and anecdotal, has produced an account that enlivens the already well-known turning points in Benjamin&#x2019;s development... This biography far surpasses not just any preceding biographical history of Benjamin but in its searching out of what remains consistent in Benjamin it has found the thread that allows a narrative of life and work to unfold in a way that does not subordinate one to the other... This achievement will remain not only a standard and resource-full account of Benjamin but in its comprehensiveness as well as its acute accounts of Benjamin&#x2019;s thought across the whole range of that thinking, it will continue to provide the foundation for the fuller understanding of his place and contribution to the critical, cultural, political and historical present we have inherited from the twentieth century.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Ferris</b><b>, </b><b><i>Critical Inquiry</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Walter Benjamin deserves to be more celebrated, and <i>Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life</i>, by Howard Eiland and Michael Jennings, is a step in the right direction.

It is also a deeply poignant story of his struggle to survive in a hostile Europe and his tragic suicide at the age of 48.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Cyril Kavanaugh</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Presented here in what looks like a definitive version, Benjamin&#x2019;s life emerges as a tragedy of incompleteness.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Gray</b><b>, </b><b><i>Literary Review</i></b></p><h2>Effective Real Estate Sales and Marketing</h2><p>Rosenauer&#39;s Effective Real Estate Sales and Marketing provides the reader with an overview of the relationship between marketing and sales and has a logical sequence of preparation steps for successful selling.

What can he have up his sleeve, the local landowners wonder, even as some rush to unload what isn&#x2019;t of any use to them anyway, while others seek to negotiate the best deal possible, and others yet hold on to their dead for dear life, since if somebody wants what you have then no matter what don&#x2019;t give it away. Chichikov&#x2019;s scheme soon encounters obstacles, but he is never without resource, and as he stumbles forward as best he can, Gogol paints a wonderfully comic picture of Russian life that also serves as a biting satire of a society as corrupt as it is cynical and silly. At once a wild phantasmagoria and a work of exacting realism, <i>Dead Souls</i> is a supremely living work of art that spills over with humor and passion and absurdity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donald Rayfield&#x2019;s vigorous new translation corrects the mistakes and omissions of earlier versions while capturing the vivid speech rhythms of the original. It also offers a fuller text of the unfinished second part of the book by combining material from Gogol&#x2019;s two surviving drafts into a single compelling narrative. This is a tour de force of art and scholarship&#x2014;and the most authoritative, accurate, and readable edition of <i>Dead Souls</i> available in English.</p><p>Nikolai Gogol (1809&#x2013;1852), the son of a gentleman farmer who was the author of Ukrainian folk comedies, was born in the Ukraine and grew up on his mother&#x2019;s family estate. He attended a variety of boarding schools, where he proved an indifferent student and made few friends but was admired for his gifts as a comic actor. In 1828 he moved to St. Petersburg and began to publish stories, and by the mid-1830s he had established himself in the literary world and been warmly praised by Pushkin. In 1836, his play <i>The Inspector-Genera</i>l was attacked as immoral, and Gogol went abroad, where he remained for most of the next twelve years. During this time he wrote two of his best-known stories, &#x201c;The Nose&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Overcoat,&#x201d; and in 1842 he published the first part of his masterpiece <i>Dead Souls</i>. Gogol became ever more religious as the years passed, and in 1847 he fell under the sway of an Orthodox priest on whose advice he burned much of the second part of <i>Dead Souls</i> and soon gave up writing altogether. After undertaking a fast to purify his soul, he died at the age of forty-two.<br><br>Donald Rayfield is emeritus professor of Russian and Georgian at Queen Mary, University of London.<p>&#x201c;Gogol's <i>Dead Souls</i>, has achieved a magnificent re-birth. . . .

Taking its title from the colloquial term &#x201c;grass&#x201d;, meaning a work of minor value, Whitman&#x2019;s &#x201c;Leaves of Grass&#x201d; is anything but that. Over his lifetime Whitman would continue to expand and revise his most famous work up until his death in 1892. The first edition contained just twelve poems, significantly smaller compared to the final &#x201c;deathbed&#x201d; edition, reproduced here, which included over 400. &#x201c;Leaves of Grass&#x201d; is unique for its celebration of the sensual pleasures of life in a time when such an attitude was considered immoral. A departure from a poetic tradition which relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, &#x201c;Leaves of Grass&#x201d; instead focused on nature and the individual&#x2019;s role in it. Initial reception of the work was quite controversial, but over time this collection of poetry has come to be acknowledged as one of the truly great American works of literature. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper and includes an introduction by John Burroughs.</p><p>One of the great innovative figures in American letters, Walt Whitman created a daringly new kind of poetry that became a major force in world literature. <i>Leaves Of Grass</i> is his one book. First published in 1855 with only twelve poems, it was greeted by Ralph Waldo Emerson as "the wonderful gift . . . the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed." Over the course of Whitman's life, the book reappeared in many versions, expanded and transformed as the author's experiences and the nation's history changed and grew. Whitman's ambition was to creates something uniquely American. In that he succeeded. His poems have been woven into the very fabric of the American character. From his solemn masterpieces "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" and "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" to the joyous freedom of "Song of Myself," "I Sing the Body Electric," and "Song of the Open Road," Whitman's work lives on, an inspiration to the poets of later generations.The poetry of Walt Whitman is the cornerstone of modern American verse. He was America's first truly great poet and his influence is still evident today. The first edition of Whitman's "Leaves of Grass, published in 1855, was a revolutionary manifesto declaring America's independence from European cultural domination. His rhapsodic free verse broke radically with poetic, tradition: it was poetry about America, its democracy, its people, and its hopes. It was uniquely American without apology--brash, proud, optimistic, and filled with the bustling energy of the new and growing nation.<br>This collection brings together Whitman's greatest and most famous poems spanning the whole of his career. From the groundbreaking first edition of "Leaves of Grass are seven poems, including "Song of Myself" and "I Sing the Body Electric."<br>From later editions there are such masterpieces as "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking," and "I Hear America Singing." Also included is Whitman's great cycle of Civil War Poems, "Drum-Taps, which he wrote in the months when he was ministering to the wounded in battlefield hospitals. Concluding this collection is one of his last poems, "Good-bye My Fancy!"--his touching farewell to his muse, his life, and his readers.<br>More than one hundred years after his death, Walt Whitman's poetry has become part of the American heritage. It is a visionary which speaks as aptly to readers today as it will to future generations. As he says in "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "others...look back on me because I look'd forward to them." Whitman's poetry is a link that connects all Americans--past, present, and future.<br>This book features a deluxe cover, ribbon marker, top stain, and decorative endpaper with a nameplate.</p><h2>Brennans of Houston in Your Kitchen</h2><p>Proving that Creole and Texas styles are kitchen-compatible, Chef Carl Walker artfully presents these distinctive tastes at the acclaimed Brennan&#39;s of Houston.

Her research and teaching is interdisciplinary, focusing on business ethics and public policy concerns.

A believer in experiential learning, Professor Halbert teaches an Executive MBA course in which managers discuss and analyze the ethical dilemmas they face at work. She earned her JD from Rutgers University, Camden."What I do NOT like about the other textbooks is that they are more "red-eye" type telling about the ethical concern and not requiring critical thinking on the part of the student to determine what is "ethical and moral" in the legal context. For example, all of the other texts tend to show "employment-at-will" with the boss being able to fire the employee with or without cause as being unethical. However, in your text, you present both sides of the legal doctrine with the employer's side being presented also. This is something that the students have never even thought about. Because of the format of this Textbook, I am able to engage the students in a lot of critical thinking on subjects of legal and ethical interest to all of them. For instance, most students have never heard the other side to things like Affirmative Action. This causes the students to begin thinking not only in the classroom but in their current and future jobs. Because of this, my course in Business Ethics with your textbook is often rated one of the most interesting and most useful course students have taken in their college life. I also get calls often from former students that have run into an ethical/legal issue in their current work that we have covered. They want to refresh their knowledge of what they learned. Therefore, your current textbook is having an impact on students in real-life situations."<br><br>"I found the Instructor's Manual invaluable.

Written primarily for children on the middle-school level, this book mixes parts of speech and proper punctuation with healthy portions of humor, down-to-earth examples, and fun illustrations that will appeal to adolescents. While kids are learning painlessly about how to make verbs agree with their subjects and pronouns with their antecedents, they look at some of the wackier words in the English language and see how they are often misused.

In this delightfully accessible book, the authors present the first full, step-by-step account of the evolution of the brain and nervous system.Tapping the very latest findings in evolutionary biology, neuroscience, and molecular biology, Rob DeSalle and Ian Tattersall explain how the cognitive gulf that separates us from all other living creatures could have occurred. They discuss the development and uniqueness of human consciousness, how human and nonhuman brains work, the roles of different nerve cells, the importance of memory and language in brain functions, and much more. Our brains, they conclude, are the product of a lengthy and supremely untidy history&#x20ac;&#x201d;an evolutionary process of many zigs and zags&#x20ac;&#x201d;that has accidentally resulte</p><p><b>Rob DeSalle</b> is curator, Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomics, American Museum of Natural History, where he has curated several special exhibitions, including <i>Brain: The Inside Story</i>. <b>Ian Tattersall</b> is curator emeritus, Division of Anthropology, American Museum of Natural History, and with DeSalle co-curated the <i>Hall of Human Origins</i> at AMNH.

Dandyism transcends fashion&#x2015;it is a committed way of life. An international survey of the global dandy community from the creators of I am Dandy. From America to Africa to Asia, dandyism is a way of life. It is fashion in the best sense, self-esteem through style. And, in every country, it takes a unique form as dandies draw on the local context and fashion culture to shape their looks. We Are Dandy throws open the doors of the wardrobe and explores the dandy as a global phenomenon. With texts as witty as the subjects are stylish, the book pokes between the folds to let us know these exceptional individuals. For them, their dandy fashion is more than a trend or a phase, it is who they are, the outer expression of their inner selves. Photographs and profiles paired with clever histories reveal what it takes to look your best around the world.</p><p>New York is more than the current home of filmmaker and photographer, ROSE CALLAHAN; the city is also the site and start of her involvement with the Dandy. In 2008, she created the blog The Dandy Portraits, where she documents the many facets of the modern gentleman. Shortly afterwards, she met Natty Adams and the idea for I am Dandy was born.<br><br>NATHANIEL "NATTY" ADAMS has been involved with the historical and contemporary Dandy phenomenon for many years&#x2015;it even informs his own wardrobe.

This text, in addition to treating the basic material in some depth, includes a wide variety of applications, both to real-world problems and to other branches of mathematics. Care has been taken to select applications which actually make use of theory, and do not merely employ the language of graphs. Among the topics included are connectivity, Euler tours and Hamilton cycles, matchings, coloring problems, planarity and network flows. Simple new proofs of theorems of Brooks, Chvatal, Tutte and Vizing are presented. Stress is laid, whenever possible, on constructive methods of proof, and several efficient algorithms are described. The many illustrations and exercises are complemented by a number of notable features, hints to harder exercises, a selection of interesting graphs with special properties, and a list of fifty unsolved problems. The text has developed from courses given by the authors at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, and is intended as an introduction to graph theory for senior mathematics undergraduates and graduates. It will also be of interest to students and workers in operations research, computer science and some branches of engineering.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>A Christmas Carol (Apple Classics)</h2><p>A miser learns the true meaning of Christmas when three ghostly visitors review his past and foretell his future</p><p>In the history of English literature, Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been continuously in print since it was first published in the winter of 1843, stands out as the quintessential Christmas story. What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun</h2><p>Following &#39;The Children of Hurin&#39;, this is Tolkien&#39;s retelling of the Norse legend.

After his father's death the family moved to Sarehole, on the south-eastern edge of Birmingham. Tolkien spent a happy childhood in the countryside and his sensibility to the rural landscape can clearly be seen in his writing and his pictures.His mother died when he was only twelve and both he and his brother were made wards of the local priest and sent to King Edward's School, Birmingham, where Tolkien shone in his classical work. After completing a First in English Language and Literature at Oxford, Tolkien married Edith Bratt. He was also commissioned in the Lancashire Fusiliers and fought in the battle of the Somme. After the war, he obtained a post on the New English Dictionary and began to write the mythological and legendary cycle which he originally called The Book of Lost Tales but which eventually became known as The Silmarillion.In 1920 Tolkien was appointed Reader in English Language at the University of Leeds which was the beginning of a distinguished academic career culminating with his election as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford. Meanwhile Tolkien wrote for his children and told them the story of The Hobbit. It was his publisher, Stanley Unwin, who asked for a sequel to The Hobbit and gradually Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings, a huge story that took twelve years to complete and which was not published until Tolkien was approaching retirement. After retirement Tolkien and his wife lived near Oxford, but then moved to Bournemouth. Tolkien returned to Oxford after his wife's death in 1971. He died on 2 September 1973 leaving The Silmarillion to be edited for publication by his son, Christopher.</p>&#34;Will appeal strongly to readers already haunted by the deeper, more sombre musics of Middle-earth&#34; The Times &#34;This is the most unexpected of Tolkien&#39;s many posthumous publications; his son&#39;s `Commentary&#39; is a model of informed accessibility; the poems stand comparison with their Eddic models, and there is little poetry in the world like those&#34; Times Literary Supplement &#34;The compact verse form is ideally suited to describing impact... elsewhere it achieves a stark beauty&#34; Telegraph</p><h2>Aircraft Performance &amp; Design (Int'l Ed) (McGraw-Hill International Editions)</h2><p>New, ship fast, delivered in 5 days in UK.

Nagle asks why some places are preserved by the law while others are not, and he finds that environmental laws often have unexpected results while other laws have surprising effects on the environment. Nagle argues that sound environmental policy requires better coordination among the many laws, regulations, and social norms that determine the values and uses of our scarce lands and waters.</p></p><p><b>John Copeland Nagle</b> is the John N.

This is a two-way interaction: the law itself is shaped by particular disputes in particular places. Professor Nagle resurrects this lost dimension of environmental law in lively, readable narratives. He tells the stories of some of the special places that have been touched by environmental law and of the people who live there.

Quite the opposite image is shared by U-boat veterans and others sympathetic to their work: the knight who endures unrivalled danger and fights nobly. Yet another popular image depicts the submarine operator as a beleaguered sailor swept along by events beyond his control. To see whether a pattern emerges, this book examines the lives of many U-Bootwaffe officers, including prominent commanders such as Karl Doenitz. Drawing on a wealth of primary documents, and also interviews and correspondence with some of the commanders themselves, the book follows individual officers from their youth and early naval training, through their wartime experiences and into the often bitter peace that followed. The close examination reveals that many were extremely different from the pictures typically drawn of them, and as varied in their thoughts and actions as other fighting men on both sides.</p><p><b>JORDAN VAUSE</b> is a 1978 graduate of the United States Naval Academy. He lives in the San Diego area and works as a quality engineer.Before reading any factual book, I always glance through the pictures and images. Only very rarely do I learn something important from this initial familiarisation. On this occasion I learned that an unofficial war between the US Navy and German submarines had been ongoing for several months before Pearl Harbour. Perhaps more importantly, apart from the portrait of D�nitz, I did not recognise any of the other photographs used. This is a book about the men who manned Germany's submarines - her U Boats. It seeks to expose their character, their weaknesses and their strengths - the very "what it was" that made them successful and made them national heroes and occasionally national villains. There are those with whom even the casual reader of U Boat history will be familiar - Prien, Kretschmer and Schepke for example. Then there are those whose exploits, in some cases, were even greater or perhaps more dastardly but, for whatever reason, kept their own personal periscope of exposure well below the surface at all times and are, therefore, less well known - Weddigen (who, in an obsolete, gas-powered U Boat, sank the 3 Cruisers HMS' Aboukir, Cressy and Hogue within 90 minutes in September 1914 and escaped without a scratch), Schwieger (who infamously sank the Lusitania in May 1915 killing 1,198 people) and Lemp (who, within 6 hours of war being declared, sank the Athenia in 1939 and, breaking every rule of warfare imaginable, killed 128 people) to name but six. It is that indefinable quality which binds together men from diverse backgrounds with very different attitudes, hopes and aspirations to perform a common task. That is what this book is all about and is, therefore essential reading for those with an interest in the U Boat. On the down side, I found the Athenia's 128 death toll described as "several hundred" - something which may (or may not) reveal a lack of attention to fine detail during the author's research. In addition, that perennial favourite of mine is the inclusion of the hyphen between "U" and "Boat." Whilst many will regard this as VERY "picky-picky," it is a fact that the hyphen does not appear after the letter "U" in connection with U Boats anywhere in original German documents but was added by English language writers. This is not a book about U Boat commanders from a British or American perspective, it is researched in Germany with a cast of former U Boat commanders and it tells their story. Consequently, U Boat, U21 and U47 are quite correct. U-Boat, U-21 and U-47 are incorrect. Whilst I may be surprised this was not spotted during research in Germany, it should not be allowed to mar the readers enjoyment of the work. --By Ned Middleton HALL OF FAME TOP 50 REVIEWER<br><br>This books deals with the common perception of U-Boat commanders of WWII; before dealing with each of the aces in turn to highlight their differences in personality &amp; ideology; thus highlighting that stereotyping is incorrect. The Aces of the U-Boat service are dealt in detail, with some very interesting stories, such as Victor Oehrn s capture in North Africa. There are also other sections that deal with the debate Karl-Friedrich Merten s &amp; Lothar-Gunther Buchheim s little disagreement over Das Boot . This book is a balanced look at the Commanders and is very well researched and a joy to read. --By "esford2"<br><br>Wolf is a departure from many of the submarine books of WWII. Rather than being a cold, dry, analysis of tonnage sunk and mission totals, it looks at the careers of a dozen U-Boat commanders as personal stories, warts and all. Starting with the illegal re-establishment of the Kriegsmarine's U-Boat fleet and particularly the early training, it progresses through the waves of new commanders who took over as their predecessors were either killed or transferred to desk jobs. Vause divides these waves into those who started in U-Boats before the war, those who joined up early and achieved commands in the early days of the war and finally, those who were fed piecemeal into the mincing machine that was the last two years of the Battle of the Atlantic. It was in these final two years when the U-Bootwaffe suffered its worst casualties. For the uninitiated, 36,000 German sailors went to war in U-Boats and 32,000 did not return, the worst casualties of any combat group in WWII. The highlight of the book for me was the odyssey of Victor Oehrn who, strangely for a submariner, was captured by Australian infantry in the North African desert! Without wishing to spoil the story, I can honestly say it would be worthy of a movie script and is very well presented by the author. A great primer for anyone wishing to familiarise themselves with the U-Boat campaign of WWII, it is not intended to be a definitive work and does not get bogged down in cold analysis. Such books have their place but this is the alternative. At times funny, often sad but usually very insightful, it must be recommended very highly. --By John Dynan</p><h2>Psychology</h2><p>This text emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and the integration of culture and gender in the science of psychology.

Mr. Karas lives in Rhinebeck, New York.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 1-This appealing addition to the series introduces odd and even numbers. When Farmer Bill dresses for outdoor chores on a snowy day, he discovers that he is short one mitten, and "One mitten's not a pair." Proceeding with his work, the farmer soon learns that his cow has the same dilemma. "They looked for her four mittens,/but there were only three." Predictably, the situation escalates. His three chickens have only five, and his two horses have only seven. Finally, Farmer Bill and his animal entourage spot the cause of their problem; it's a mitten-chewing goat. Artfully enhanced by Karas's amusing illustrations, the rhyming text bounces along smoothly. With spectacles perched on the tip of his nose, Farmer Brown wears a comically perplexed look on his face. Colorful borders and warm background colors provide a nice balance to the snowy scenes. Charts help to show the difference between the number of mittens found (odd) and the number needed (even). As in other entries in the series, suggestions for additional activities to extend the math concept are included. This well-executed title works well with or without the math; use it to clarify a concept or read it aloud as an enjoyable winter romp.<br><i>Alicia Eames, New York City Public Schools </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Anne of Green Gables (Great Illustrated Classics)</h2><p>Anne, an eleven-year-old orphan, is sent by mistake to live with a lonely, middle-aged brother and sister on a Prince Edward Island farm and proceeds to make an indelible impression on everyone around her.</p><p>When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables, Prince Edward Island, send for a boy orphan to help them out at the farm, they are in no way prepared for the error that will change their lives. The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history.

The Columbian Exposition also marked the dramatic reengagement of the LDS Church with the non-Mormon world after decades of seclusion in the Great Basin. <br> Between May and October 1893, over seven thousand Latter-day Saints from Utah attended the international spectacle popularly described as the ''White City.'' While many traveled as tourists, oblivious to the opportunities to ''exhibit'' Mormonism, others actively participated to improve their church's public image. Hundreds of congregants helped create, manage, and staff their territory's impressive exhibit hall; most believed their besieged religion would benefit from Utah's increased national profile. Moreover, a good number of Latter-day Saint women represented the female interests and achievements of both Utah and its dominant religion. These women hoped to use the Chicago World's Fair as a platform to improve the social status of their gender and their religion. Additionally, two hundred and fifty of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir's best singers competed in a Welsh eiseddfodd, a musical competition held in conjunction with the Chicago World's Fair, and Mormon apologist Brigham H. Roberts sought to gain LDS representation at the affiliated Parliament of Religions. <br> In the first study ever written of Mormon participation at the Chicago World's Fair, Reid L. Neilson explores how Latter-day Saints attempted to ''exhibit'' themselves to the outside world before, during, and after the Columbian Exposition, arguing that their participation in the Exposition was a crucial moment in the Mormon migration to the American mainstream and its leadership's discovery of public relations efforts. After 1893, Mormon leaders sought to exhibit their faith rather than be exhibited by others.<br></p><p><br><strong>Reid L.

It is a worthwhile read for those seeking to understand Mormon public relations." --<em>Deseret News</em> <br><p></p><br>"Neilson's account of the Utah/Mormon presence at the 1893 World's Fair shows the enormous appeal of Mormonism's secular dimensions. It also reveals how very unwelcome its religious aspects were. These are important additions to LDS history. But this work's greatest contribution is the author's observation about what LDS leaders learned in Chicago. Ever since, much more of the church's time and energy has featured 'those Amazing Mormons' rather than their distinctive system of belief." --Jan Shipps, Professor Emeritus of History and Religious Studies, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis <br><p></p><br>"In <em>Exhibiting Mormonism,</em> Reid Neilson offers a fascinating glimpse into both the efforts by Mormons beginning in the 1890s to represent their faith to a skeptical public, as well as to the reactions by Protestants and others to the newly public face of a growing religious movement. This vivid account expands our knowledge of the popular transformation of Mormons from heretics to patriots in the twentieth century." --Laurie F. Maffly-Kipp, author of <em>Setting Down the Sacred Past: African American Race Histories</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"The 1893 Columbian Exposition was Mormonism's coming out party. It launched the now massive public relations effort to make friends for the Church as well as converts. After suffering from isolation and ignominy for half a century, Mormons at last had a place in the sun. Reid Neilson tells in fascinating detail how much the Exposition meant to Mormons and the impact their participation had on visitors. This is a critical part of Mormonism's transition to American citizenship." --Richard Bushman, Gouverneur Morris Professor Emeritus of History, Columbia University <br><p></p><br>""...an excellent case-study...." --<em>Blair Dee Hodges, Association for Mormon Letters</em> <br><p></p><br>"Lucidly written and engaging, Neilson's work addresses multiple scholarly fields from American religious history to gender and women's studies...Neilson will surely produce many more insightful studies." --<em>Journal of Illinois History</em> <br><p></p><br>"...Neilson brings a new and unknown dimension of Mormon history into view.

Thoroughly optimistic, the book invites students to approach ethical issues with a reconstructive intent--to "break out of the box" in order to make room for more and better options than the rigid "pro" and "con" positions that have developed around tough problems like abortion and environmental ethics. In this book, ethics is treated not as an invitation to issue summary moral judgments or to construct and evaluate moral theories, but as an ongoing set of real-life challenges that call for multiple, integrated, and open-ended kinds of intelligence. Anthony Weston covers the skills that are vital to making real progress in ethics, including critical thinking, creative problem-solving, moral vision, mindful speech, and many more. Readers will find refreshing examples of real people and communities who have made progress in reframing and resolving ethical dilemmas by thinking and acting in constructive and innovative ways. Instructors can readily use the experiential and applied activities inspired by this "toolbox" of skills to design an interactive and collaborative ethics course, and students will find the resources and the encouragement to carry those skills into practice.<br> <em>A 21st Century Ethical Toolbox</em> addresses a broad spectrum of compelling ethical issues, including abortion, sexual choices, what and how we eat, crime and punishment, fair trade, environmental justice, and many others. Provocative selections from a wide range of philosophers, essayists, community activists, and students are interwoven with Weston's own discussions.

You will make out intricacies, so delicate and subtle, so exact and compact, so full of knots and links, with colours so fresh and vivid, that you might say that all this was the work of an angel, and not of a man." &#x2014; Giraldus Cambrensis, <i>Topographia Hiberniae, </i>ca. 1185.Gerald of Wales wrote his ecstatic description of what is most probably the Book of Kells 800 years ago, some 300 years after the work appeared. It remains the best description; he felt and conveyed the Book's power, the mystery that made it even then unique among early medieval manuscripts. <br>While clearly subject to international influence (Celtic, British, Norman; possibly Italian, Byzantine, and Coptic), the Book of Kells' painters and scribes illumined their work with a purely idiosyncratic beauty. The Book of Kells is more an icon than a typical evangelistary; indeed, the Saint Jerome text of the gospels is frequently corrupt or carelessly rendered, so intent were the artists on their ornament and iconography. <br>One may still see the glorious ornament on display at Trinity College, Dublin; a more accessible version is this, newly reproduced from a rare facsimile edition. Thirty-two full-page, full-color plates have been selected and painstakingly printed to retain the ineffable handpainted impression of the original leaves. All the full-page decorations, portraits, and illustrations are included, as well as a representative sampling of the textual leaves, in their graceful Insular (half-uncial) calligraphy, interspersed and initialed with an imaginative, fanciful, and even humorous bestiary of lions, lambs, eagles, otters, cats, dragons, birds, fish, and snakes; strange men are seen in the cross-armed Osiris position, entwined in lion's tails, snakes, vines, and peacock feathers. The interlacing and spiraling follow the Insular tradition; in botanical ornament the Book stands apart from that school. The illustrations include vital specimens of Western art: the first image of the Virgin and Child in a Western manuscript, and numerous early representations of the Apocalyptic visionary symbols of the Evangelists; symbols that lost their eeriness in later, diluted form, but that in the Book of Kells, according to one scholar, "retain their wild, unearthly quality. They are perhaps the most striking element in the decoration of the Book." <br>Perusers of this Book, casual and serious students of art, religion, or Western culture, will echo Giraldus, who wrote: "For my part, the oftener I see the book, and the more carefully I study it, the more I am lost in ever fresh amazement, and I see more and more wonders in the book."<br></p><p></p><h2>The World Of Jewish Cooking: More Than 400 Delectable Recipes from Jewish Communities</h2><p>Designed to be the cornerstone of every Jewish kitchen, a substantial collection of kosher recipes from two dozen communities around the world also includes holiday dishes and lore about the history of Jewish food throughout the ages. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Rabbi Marks explains how the Jews, spreading to all corners of the world beginning with the Diaspora, adapted their recipes to local ingredients and adopted the local fare, often giving it new twists.

This book features a wealth of examples, problems, and laboratory exercises to illustrate how the theory in the lectures is applied to actual engineering science.</p><p>As one of the standard undergraduate texts in signals and linear systems theory, this manual is geared toward an advanced undergraduate student with a strong background in calculus and a previous introductory course in differential equations. The author uses a circuit analysis framework to introduce several key ideas such as state-space descriptions of differential and difference equations, Laplace and z-transforms, continuous-time and discrete-time Fourier transforms, and sampling, filtering, and modulation schemes. Through enthusiastic prose and numerous worked-out examples, Siebert conveys his intuitive feel for the meaning behind the mathematics as well as a deep familiarity with electrical engineering applications of the theory. The book is fast-paced and challenging, but not overly terse. This text is perfect for a student and an excellent reference (as well as an enjoyable read) for practicing engineers and academics.William Siebert is Ford Professor of Engineering at MIT.</p><h2>State-Directed Development: Political Power and Industrialization in the Global Periphery</h2><p>Why have some developing countries industrialized and become more prosperous rapidly while others have not?

Her sober, black-and-white depictions of Eastern Europe, shot in natural light on a variety of formats and cameras, explored concepts of borders, national identity and the vulnerability of humans within the continuum of history and world conflict. Upon her receipt of the prestigious Henri Cartier-Bresson Award in 2011, Robert Delpire observed: "Her work might be seen as a classic documentary approach but in fact it features a sensitivity and complexity that is deeply contemporary." This first broad survey of her work (previous monographs have focused on single series) lusciously reproduces her many acclaimed projects: <i>Imagined States and Desires: A Balkan Journey</i> (1999&#x2013;2003); <i>Black Sea: Between Chronicle and Fiction</i> (2002&#x2013;10); <i>Georgia: Seeds Carried by the Wind</i> (2008&#x2013;10); <i>Sweet Nothings: Schoolgirls of Eastern Anatolia</i> (2007); <i>Humber</i> (2010); the widely acclaimed <i>She Dances on Jackson</i> (2011&#x2013;12), of which Phil Coomes of <i>BBC News</i> raved: "This is pure photography, and ... viewed as a whole, is about as good as it gets"; and her most recent series, <i>Almer�a: Where Gold Was Found</i> (2014). Also included are specially commissioned essays by Neil Ascherson, Stanley Wolukau-Wanambwa and Carlos Mart�n Garc�a; excerpts from books by Juan Goytisolo; plus a biography timeline, an updated bibliography and a selection of texts by the photographer used to complement each series in the style of a travel diary.</p><p></p><h2>Moby Dick</h2><p>Captain Ahab takes his crew on a mission to find Moby Dick, the great white whale that crippled him.</p><p></p><h2>The Physics of Dance</h2><p>Explains the effects of the laws of gravity, momentum and energy on the bodies of dancers</p><p></p><h2>Moby Dick</h2><p>Ishmael, a sailor, recounts the ill-fated voyage of a whaling ship led by the fanatical Captain Ahab in search of the white whale that had crippled him, in a story told in comic book format.</p><p>Gr 4-7-Eisner's Moby Dick is simplistic, the whalebone without the whale. Melville's subtleties sink under the comic-book format, and while the cartoonist does a creditable job of conveying the basic story of Ishmael, Queequeg, and Ahab, drama is inevitably sacrificed. Because of the way the panels are divided, it is difficult to know which one to read next, resulting in some confusion about plot sequence. That said, Eisner's cartoons are charged with atmosphere, their sea tones and moody contrasts well suited to their subject. While younger readers may stumble over some of the sentence structure ("Who first sights him shall have this gold!"), the book may appeal to comic-book fans and reluctant readers.<p></p><p><i>Susan Weitz, Tompkins County Public Library, Ithaca, NY</i></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Comic book aficionados will appreciate master Will Eisner's latest adaptation, Moby Dick. It may not begin, "Call me Ishmael," but the story otherwise remains true to Herman Melville's classic, with Queequeg, Ahab and the great white whale all making their entrances on cue. The cartoon panels that chronicle the final showdown between the captain and the giant fish are particularly spectacular. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Living in the Borderland:The Evolution of Consciousness and the Challenge of Healing Trauma</h2><p><p><em>Living in the Borderland</em> addresses the evolution of Western consciousness and describes the emergence of the &#x2018;Borderland,' a spectrum of reality that is beyond the rational yet is palpable to an increasing number of individuals. Building on Jungian theory, Jerome Bernstein argues that a greater openness to transrational reality experienced by Borderland personalities allows new possibilities for understanding and healing confounding clinical and developmental enigmas.</p> <p>There are many people whose experiences of reality is outside the mainstream of Western culture; often they see themselves as abnormal because they have no articulated frame of reference for their experience. The concept of the Borderland personality explains much of their experience.</p> <p>In three sections, this book examines the psychological and clinical implications of the evolution of consciousness and looks at how the new Borderland consciousness bridges the mind-body divide. Subjects covered include: </p> <p></p> <p>� Genesis: Evolution of the Western Ego </p> <p></p> <p>� Transrational Data in a Western Clinical Context: Synchronicity</p> <p>� Trauma and Borderland Transcendence</p> <p>� Environmental Illness Complex</p> <p>� Integration of Navajo and Western healing approaches for Borderland Personalities.</p> <p></p> <p>Living in the Borderland challenges the standard clinical model, which views normality as an absence of pathology and which equates normality with the rational. Jerome S. Bernstein describes how psychotherapy itself often contributes to the alienation of Borderland personalities by misperceiving the difference between the pathological and the sacred. The case studies included illustrate the potential this has for causing serious psychic and emotional damage to the patient. </p> <p>This challenge to the orthodoxies and complacencies of Western medicine&#x2019;s concept of pathology will interest Jungian Analysts, Psychotherapists, Psychiatrists and other physicians, as well as educators of children. </p> <p><strong>Jerome S.

And it is the front door of his studio that somehow seems to play the leading role in this book. During one year, from May 1998 to May 1999, Teller was visited by hundreds of girls, sent to him by agencies for a casting shoot. At the beginning of this book there was a simple idea that struck Teller: why not photograph all his young female visitors and turn the result into a convincing conceptual piece of art photography? The result is striking, sometimes funny, and makes us question the fashion industry and its world of models. We encounter girls, mostly around the age of 16 or 17, presenting themselves to the photographer in the hope of a great career. Sometimes they come alone, sometimes in groups, sometimes accompanied by their parents. Captured in different lights of the changing seasons, but always at the entrance of Teller&#39;s studio, the portraits seem to melt into one single portrait - that of the one and only model, whatever she might look like.</p><p></p><h2>Traditional Couture: Folkloric Heritage Costumes</h2><p>Traditional clothing represents the regions where it is produced along with their cultures and handcraft. Its creativity and longevity is inspiring high fashion designers of today and tomorrow. Traditional clothing is essentially haute couture. Made with high quality fabrics and elaborate workmanship, it embodies cultural heritage and style. Encompassing a surprising variety of garments, it represents premioum handcraft, an awareness of tradition, a sense of belonging, and an affinity to one&#39;s homeland. At the same time, folkloric clothing is inspriing some of today and tomorrow&#39;s most ambitious and radical fashion designers. In Traditional Couture, photographer Gregor Hohenberg succeeds in building a visual bridge between the outmoded and the avant-garde in German folkloric fashion. He portrays the individuals, young and old alike, who wear traditional attire in all the regions of his homeland, as well as their surroundings. Furthermore, he depicts the distinctive garments in all their glorious detail: pearls, seams, embroidery, and colors--all of which are completely unaffected by the seasonal influences of the fashion industry. This book is a dazzling journey in pictures featuring an almost overwhelming abundance of visual symbols and stylistic inspiration. At the same time, Traditional Couture captures the grace and dignity with which clothing is worn. The book eschews kitschy German folklore to show how donning traditional dress can change one&#39;s composure, lend charisma, and make statement while providing a relaxed sense of self-confidence and feeding passion for special attire at special occassions. There is simply no other clothing that represents the wearer&#39;s biography and region in quite the same way. Traditional German outfits are made to last a lifetime and handed down to future generations. Some of their details are so elaborately made that hardly anyone has the time or skill to create them today. Tailors that still master this art are in high demand far beyond regional borders. Consequently, traditional clothing is a handcraft that connects people. The distinctive quality, identity, and intensity of the attire featured in Traditional Couture is inspiring fashion designers to rethink their collections in new directions. While giant fashion brands are surrendering to global, fast-lived trends, more and more small manufacturers are creating enduring garments: heirlooms instead of throw-away t-shirts.</p><p>"Showcases . . . [German] costumes that are essentially story-telling artworks. In a country where no one expects to find such a rich fashion tradition, [they] surprise us with their high-quality fabrics and elaborate workmanship." <p>&#x2015;<i>Yatzer</i></p></p><h2>DEWALT Wiring Diagrams Professional Reference (DEWALT Series)</h2><p>The DEWALT Wiring Diagrams Professional Reference is a must for anyone who installs or replaces electrical wiring.

In Deals from Hell, Robert Bruner, one of the foremost thinkers and educators in this field, uncovers the real reasons for these mishaps by taking a closer look at twelve specific instances of M&amp;A failure. Through these real-world examples, he shows readers what went wrong and why, and converts these examples into cautionary tales for executives who need to know how they can successfully navigate their own M&amp;A deals. These page-turning business narratives in M&amp;A failure provide much-needed guidance in this area of business. By addressing the key factors to M&amp;A success and failure, this comprehensive guide illustrates the best ways to analyze, design, and implement M&amp;A deals. Filled with in-depth insights, expert advice, and valuable lessons gleaned from other M&amp;A transactions, Deals from Hell helps readers avoid the common pitfalls associated with this field and presents them with a clear framework for thinking about how to make any M&amp;A transaction a success.</p><p>Given the sheer complexity of M&amp;A deals, it's easy to see why so many of them fall short of their intended goals. Although mergers and acquisitions are no easy path to riches, it's definitely not a loser's game either. With the right attitude and understanding, it is possible to succeed in the world of mergers and acquisitions, and Robert Bruner, one of the foremost thinkers and educators in this field, wants to show you how. <p>The study of failure is the source of thoughtful advances, and in Deals from Hell: M&amp;A Lessons That Rise Above the Ashes, Bruner focuses on M&amp;A failures to help you achieve M&amp;A success. Comprised of three information-packed parts--The Foundations of M&amp;A Failure; Case Studies of M&amp;A Failures; and Avoiding the Deal from Hell--this comprehensive guide offers a realistic look at how M&amp;A transactions really work.</p> <p>By addressing the key factors of M&amp;A failure and success, Deals from Hell illustrates the best ways to analyze, design, and implement your own M&amp;A deals. You'll gain valuable perspectives from the standpoint of previous research, and through ten real-world case studies, you'll discover how little an M&amp;A situation must differ in order to deliver rather different results. Some of the cases examined include: </p> <ul> <li>AOL and Time Warner</li> <li>The acquisition of Snapple by Quaker Oats</li> <li>The acquisition of Columbia Pictures by Sony Corporation</li> <li>Renault's proposed merger with Volvo</li> <li>Mattel's acquisition of The Learning Company</li> <li>The acquisition program of Tyco International</li> </ul> <p>All of the cases presented are paired with a counterpoint or complementary case. The comparison cases are not intended to be deals from heaven--they're merely examples of how thin the line is between M&amp;A success and failure. After you've become familiar with the research and cases outlined in the first two sections of the book, Bruner concludes his M&amp;A discussion with a look at the implications of these deals for CEOs, investors, and those concerned with public policy.</p> <p>Filled with in-depth insights, expert advice, and valuable lessons gleaned from notably bad M&amp;A transactions, Deals from Hell will change the way you think about M&amp;A and help you understand--as well as anticipate--the obstacles to M&amp;A success.</p>"Whether you are an investor or dealmaker, corporate executive or aspiring MBA looking for a career on Wall Street, you are sure to find this book both troublesome and inspiring...it cannot be otherwise when you carefully examine a series of M&amp;A 'train wrecks' through the same lens as Prof. Bruner, a creative teacher in the field of M&amp;A, who has been able to extract the hard, instructive lessons from these disasters." <br> &#x2015;From the Foreword by Arthur Levitt, Jr., former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and author of Take On the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know <p>"Deals from Hell is a fresh and interesting look at the M&amp;A game written by Prof. Robert Bruner, a leading authority on the topic. He studies failures and from this unique perspective, teaches us the pitfalls to avoid as well as the positive actions for success. The case histories illuminated herein are worthy instruction for all CEOs and their top management team."<br> &#x2015;Tom Copeland, Managing Director of Corporate Finance, Monitor Group</p> <p>"There is a very fine line between M&amp;A heaven and hell&#x2015;and it is no surprise that the devil is in the detail. Contrary to conventional wisdom, mergers work, on average, as Bob Bruner documents&#x2015;and the reasons why are often worthy of more careful study than appears beneath the headlines of the popular press. Bruner drills down on disasters and successes like no one else&#x2015;and leaves investors and M&amp;A dealmakers with a truly balanced scorecard of important lessons to ponder."<br> &#x2015;Charles D. Ellis, author of Winning the Loser's Game and Capital: The Story of Long-Term Investment Excellence</p> <p>"While the average return to M&amp;A acquirers is a matter of some controversy, it is beyond question that many acquisitions work well and many work badly.

And teachers, like the rest of the population, aren't perfect. Yet good teaching happens, and great teachers continue to inspire and educate generations of students. <i>See Me After Class helps those great teachers of the future to survive the classroom long enough to become great. <br> Fueled by hundreds of hilarious--and sometimes shocking--tales from the teachers who lived them, Elden provides tips and strategies that deal head-on with the challenges that <em>aren't</em> covered in new-teacher training. Lessons can go wrong. Parents may yell at you. Sunday evenings will sometimes be accompanied by the dreaded countdown to Monday morning. As a veteran teacher, Elden offers funny, practical, and honest advice, to help teachers walk through the doors of their classrooms day after day with clarity, confidence...and sanity! <br> "A useful, empathetic guide to weathering the first-year lumps...a frothy, satisfying Guinness for the teacher's soul."--Dan Brown, NBCT, Director of the Future Educators Association, and author of <em>The Great Expectations School</em><br> "<em>See Me After Class</em> is a must-have book for any teacher's bookshelf. On second thought, you'll probably want to keep it on your classroom desk since you'll use it so much!"--Larry Ferlazzo, teacher and author of <em>Helping Students Motivate Themselves </em><br> "This is the kind of no-nonsense straight talk that teachers are starved for, but too rarely get...Roxanna Elden tells it like it is, with a heavy dose of practicality, a dash of cynicism, a raft of constructive suggestions, and plenty of wry humor."--Rick Hess, Director of Education Policy Studies at AEI, author of <em>Education Week</em></i><em> blog, "Rich Hess Straight Up"</em></p><p><b>Roxanna Elden</b> has taught adult education, elementary school, middle school, high school, day school, night school, Saturday school, and summer school. She has stood in front of classrooms in big cities from Chicago to Houston.

They instinctively motivate students, set high expectations, and manage-not discipline-their classes. They stay positive and organized, tracking progress in binders of color-coded data and planning lessons that address each child's unique learning modality. These teachers don't just teach-they inspire! They spring out of bed each morning knowing materials are laid out, papers are graded, and their classrooms are welcoming environments where all students can succeed. This book is not for them.</p> <p>This book is for anyone who wishes those teachers would stop telling you how organized they are while you stare at a growing stack of ungraded essays. It's for those of you who are sleeping less than ever before, raising your voices louder than you ever imagined you would, and wondering why kids take sooooo long in the bathroom and often come out covered in water. This is for any new teacher wondering whether to get out of bed at all.</p> <p>Read this when a lesson goes horribly wrong, when your whole class "forgets" a major project, or when a parent curses at you in front of the kids. Pull it out at lunch on a bad day or on Sunday night as you battle those six-more-hours-till-Monday stomach cramps. This is meant to get you to school tomorrow.</p> <p>But first, a few warnings...</p> <p><strong>THIS BOOK IS NOT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</strong></p> <p>No book can replace the difficult, necessary process of learning to teach. Read this after you have attended more than enough workshops, received so many lists of recommended books you get tired from reading the lists, and gotten plenty of advice about time-consuming things you could do to be a better teacher. I'm assuming you've heard the terms benchmark, classroom management, and data-driven instruction. You also know which of these describes what you were doing wrong when your principal walked in.</p> <p>You may even be enrolled in a certification program, where you spend some of the longest hours of your life watching PowerPoint presentations on the importance of hands-on lessons, taking multiple-choice practice tests, and praying this isn't how your students feel while you're teaching.</p> <p>This book is meant to keep you from getting discouraged when it seems like all those fabulous ideas you learned in training don't work in your own classroom: no one understands the directions, it turns out you had no business giving those kids glue in the first place, and it also turns out the National Geographic magazines you found cheap and felt great about became a gallery of nude pictures for your sixth-graders. It's also for the next day, when parents show up to complain-even though their kids are downloading much more graphic pictures on their home computers and bringing them to school...which is why their printers ran out of ink...which is why their projects aren't finished.</p> <p>You, on the other hand, still have to prepare that sample hands-on lesson plan for your training class tonight.</p> <p><strong>THIS BOOK IS NOT CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE TEACHER'S SOUL</strong></p> <p>It's more like Hard Liquor for the Teacher's Soul-new teachers need something stronger than chicken soup. Read this on the days when any book by a teacher who taught kids to play violin during lunch or took busloads of perfectly behaved fifth-graders on a tour of college campuses makes you want to beat your head against the wall until pieces of scalp and hair are all over the place.</p> <p>The basis for this book is an idea that worked for me: teachers willing to admit their mistakes are much more helpful to rookies than those who say, "Well, they would know better than to do that in my class." The stories in this book should be bad enough to make you feel better.</p> <p>The real reason to feel better, though, is that all the people who shared their stories in this book went on to become successful, experienced teachers. They're not administrators (who, don't get me wrong, do important jobs). They're not counselors (who also do important jobs). They're not presenters or auditors from a downtown office (who do...jobs).</p> <p>They are teachers. In classrooms. And they love it-most days.</p> <p><strong>THIS BOOK IS NOT TEACHING FOR DUMMIES</strong></p> <p>Dummies shouldn't be teachers. As a country, we need educators who have brains, dedication, enthusiasm, and common sense. We need people who want to change things in the schools where things most need to change.</p> <p>But we need you to stay at your jobs, and stay sane.</p> <p>Acting like a hard job can be done easily is a sure way to do it wrong. The knowledge teachers need is complicated, it's important, and it's way more than anyone can learn in one year. The great teachers of the future know they're not great yet. They know they're making mistakes, and some of those mistakes are big. They're sorting through a million pieces of advice, each starting with the words "All you have to do is...," until they want to lie on their backs in the school hallway and yell, "This is all the time and energy I have! Can someone please tell me what I should really spend it on?"</p> <p>If you can relate to the preceding paragraph, you were my inspiration. And this book is for you.</p> <p></p></p><h2>The Collector of Treasures and Other Botswana Village Tales (2nd Edition)</h2><p>Botswana village tales about subjects such as the breakdown of family life and the position of women in this society.</p><p><p>Born in South Africa, Bessie Head, had a traumatic life and she drew heavily upon her experiences for her novels. Her first novel, <i>When Rain Clouds Gather</i> grew out of her experience as a refugee, and was followed by <i>Maru</i> and <i>A Question of Power</i> (1973). In 1977 she published <i>The Collector of Treasure</i>s, a book of short stories exploring the position of women in Africa. </p> <br>Bessie Head died in Serowe, Botswana in 1986, aged only 49.<i>Collector of Treasures</i> explores the lives of Botswana villagers, both before their colonization by the British and after their independence in 1966. Bessie Head tells tales of ancient leaders, of educated women trying to find their way between city and village life, of women who must suffer while men treat the independence of their country as an opportunity to throw away all restrictions, British or tribal. In these stories, it is the women who suffer most - who bear the children after the men have deserted them, who endure the village gossip, who raise the money for their children's school fees as their husbands support other women. But though they suffer, these are women of strength and inner beauty. Johannah, tall and striking, reminds the villagers "the children of a real woman do not get lean or die." Dikeledi, in jail for killing her husband, still "had always found gold amidst the ash, deep loves that had joined her heart to the hearts of others." While men are often the villains of these stories, <i>Collector of Treasures</i> also creates a new hero, the kind of man she calls "a poem of tenderness." Bessie Head's love for her characters is rich and glowing, as strong as her anger at those, British or African, who destroy the traditions of empathy, hard-work, and sharing that lie at the heart of this goodness. Her words flow through their "uncertain story of independence" like a great, golden river. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Erica Bauermeister</i></p><h2>Religion in the Emergence of Civilization: �atalh�y�k as a Case Study</h2><p>This book presents an interdisciplinary study of the role of spirituality and religious ritual in the emergence of complex societies. Involving an eminent group of natural scientists, archaeologists, anthropologists, philosophers, and theologians, this volume examines �atalh�y�k as a case study. A nine-thousand-year old town in central Turkey, �atalh�y�k was first excavated in the 1960s and has since become integral to understanding the symbolic and ritual worlds of the early farmers and village-dwellers in the Middle East. It is thus an ideal location for exploring theories about the role of religion in early settled life. This book provides a unique overview of current debates concerning religion and its historical variations. Through exploration of themes including the integration of the spiritual and the material, the role of belief in religion, the cognitive bases for religion, and religion&#39;s social roles, this book situates the results from �atalh�y�k within a broader understanding of the Neolithic in the Middle East.</p><p>This book presents an interdisciplinary study of the role of spirituality and religious ritual in the emergence of complex societies, using �atalh�y�k as a case study.

Many assume these are the things that define an American teenager&#x2019;s first year after high school. But the reality is really quite different. As Tim Clydesdale reports in <i>The First Year Out,</i> teenagers generally manage the increased responsibilities of everyday life immediately after graduation effectively. But, like many good things, this comes at a cost.<br> <br> Tracking the daily lives of fifty young people making the transition to life after high school, Clydesdale reveals how teens settle into manageable patterns of substance use and sexual activity; how they meet the requirements of postsecondary education; and how they cope with new financial expectations. Most of them, we learn, handle the changes well because they make a priority of everyday life. But Clydesdale finds that teens also stow away their identities&#x2014;religious, racial, political, or otherwise&#x2014;during this period in exchange for acceptance into mainstream culture. This results in the absence of a long-range purpose for their lives and imposes limits on their desire to understand national politics and global issues, sometimes even affecting the ability to reconstruct their lives when tragedies occur.<br> <br> <i>The First Year Out</i> is an invaluable resource for anyone caught up in the storm and stress of working with these young adults.</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p>Tim Clydesdale is associate professor of sociology at the College of New Jersey."Tim Clydesdale has done a remarkable job of getting inside the minds and lives of American teenagers.&nbsp;I know of no other study that provides as rich and up-to-date insights into the decisions teenagers make as they leave high school and enter the work force and college.&nbsp;The stories are riveting.&nbsp;The candid confessions about doubts and anxieties are sobering.&nbsp;<i>The First Year Out</i> is an example of sociological research at its best." (Robert Wuthnow, Princeton University, author of The Next Wave:&nbsp; How Young Adults Are Shaping American Religion 2007-01-02)<br><br>"Tim Clydesdale provides a new and powerful vision of America&#x2019;s young people.&nbsp; He opened my eyes to realities I never imagined even though I have been studying the nation&#x2019;s college students for the past&nbsp;twenty five&nbsp;years." (Arthur Levine, President, Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation 2007-01-02)<br><br>&#x201c;This is an excellent book, with scholarship and writing of the kind that more sociologists ought to be producing. It is exceptional in its longitudinal and qualitative focus on this life-course transition, its fascinating big-picture story, its consistent and understandable plot-line, and its counter-intuitive overturning of big cultural stereotypes about life after high school. Clydesdale&#x2019;s observations about stability and managing daily life tasks are fascinating, and provide important contributions to our substantive understanding of this important piece of social life." (Christian Smith, author of Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers 2006-09-19)<br><br>"A high;y readable, compassionate, and empathetic look at the lives of young people as they leave high school and enter universities, colleges, vocational schools, and employment. . . . [It] should be of interest to life course, youth, and education scholars alike." (Wolfgang Lehmann <i>Canadian Journal of Sociology</i>)<br><br>"Clydesdale has written an engaging and accessible book about how American teens experience their school life, family life, work life, religious life, peer life, and leisure time. It is filled with delicious nuggets of information as well as thoughtful (and sometimes surprising) claims about who American teens are, and what, if anything, 'we' can do about it. . . . This book has much to recommend it and I encourage educators to read it in order to gain some insight about the worldview of the people they intend to educate. Also, I would not hesitate to assign it in an upper-division sociology of adolescence class." (Robert C. Bulman <i>Teaching Sociology</i>)<br><br>"Clydesdale provides directives for all educators (faculty, residence life, student activities, career services) who work with first year students. . . . His is an interesting voice in the dialogue on how incoming students are changing." (Katie Beres <i>NACADA Journal</i>)<br><br>"Worthwhile reading for a number of different audiences. It is relevant to educators, as its vivid descriptions of youth culture will inform, and likely challenge, pedagogical practices. The depiction of youth culture will also be helpful to social practitioners and others engaged in direct practice with young people in their late teens. . . . Finally, scholars of American Culture will find it a fascinating reflection on mainstream culture." (Sarah Taylor <i>Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare</i>)<br><br>"Cydesdale's impressive study yielded a rich and entertainingly told story of what young people are up to in their first year beyond the family nest.

Reading selections in the chapters provide coverage of both classical and contemporary philosophical writings, representing a spectrum of viewpoints on each theory or topic. The readings include brief introductions to assist students in identifying key ideas and have been selected and edited in order to optimize student comprehension.

Selling in the millions each year for the past six decades, comic books have figured prominently in the childhoods of most Americans alive today. In <i>Comic Book Nation</i>, Bradford W. Wright offers an engaging, illuminating, and often provocative history of the comic book industry within the context of twentieth-century American society.</p><p>From Batman's Depression-era battles against corrupt local politicians and Captain America's one-man war against Nazi Germany to Iron Man's Cold War exploits in Vietnam and Spider-Man's confrontations with student protestors and drug use in the early 1970s, comic books have continually reflected the national mood, as Wright's imaginative reading of thousands of titles from the 1930s to the 1980s makes clear. In every genre&#x2015;superhero, war, romance, crime, and horror comic books&#x2015;Wright finds that writers and illustrators used the medium to address a variety of serious issues, including racism, economic injustice, fascism, the threat of nuclear war, drug abuse, and teenage alienation. At the same time, xenophobic wartime series proved that comic books could be as reactionary as any medium.</p><p>Wright's lively study also focuses on the role comic books played in transforming children and adolescents into consumers; the industry's ingenious efforts to market their products to legions of young but savvy fans; the efforts of parents, politicians, religious organizations, civic groups, and child psychologists like Dr. Fredric Wertham (whose 1954 book <i>Seduction of the Innocent,</i> a salacious expos� of the medium's violence and sexual content, led to U.S. Senate hearings) to link juvenile delinquency to comic books and impose censorship on the industry; and the changing economics of comic book publishing over the course of the century. For the paperback edition, Wright has written a new postscript that details industry developments in the late 1990s and the response of comic artists to the tragedy of 9/11. <i>Comic Book Nation</i> is at once a serious study of popular culture and an entertaining look at an enduring American art form.</p></p><p>"Pow!

This neighborhood-the Garden District-was situated along one of the first street railway lines in the country, and became one of the earliest commuter suburbs. It remains an enduring achievement of architectural and residential planning. <br><i>Southern Comfort </i>details the magnificent architecture and planning of the Garden District. Through the histories of the developers, owners, architects, laborers, and craftspeople who shaped this district, the book creates a picture of a uniquely cosmopolitan city in the American South. <br>This title, first published in 1989 and long unavailable, has been carefully updated by the author. It includes 90 new color photographs, showing the brightly painted facades for which this neighborhood is famous, domestic interiors that have never been published, and restoration efforts that have occurred in the past decade.</p><p>S.

In <i>Incontinence of the Void </i>(the title is inspired by a sentence in Samuel Beckett's late masterpiece Ill Seen Ill Said), &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek explores the empty spaces between philosophy, psychoanalysis, and the critique of political economy. He proceeds from the universal dimension of philosophy to the particular dimension of sexuality to the singular dimension of the critique of political economy. The passage from one dimension to another is immanent: the ontological void is accessible only through the impasses of sexuation and the ongoing prospect of the abolition of sexuality, which is itself opened up by the technoscientific progress of global capitalism, in turn leading to the critique of political economy.</p><p>Responding to his colleague and fellow Short Circuits author Alenka Zupancic's <i>What </i>Is <i>Sex?</i>, &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek examines the notion of an excessive element in ontology that gives body to radical negativity, which becomes the antagonism of sexual difference. From the economico-philosophical perspective, &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek extrapolates from ontological excess to Marxian surplus value to Lacan's surplus enjoyment. In true &#x17d;i&#x17e;ekian fashion,<i> Incontinence of the Void</i> focuses on eternal topics while detouring freely into contemporary issuesfrom the Internet of Things to Danish TV series.</p></p><p>Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek, a philosopher and cultural critic, is Senior Researcher in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London.

(c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>The Book of Revelation: Apocalypse and Empire</h2><p>About seventy years after the death of Jesus, John of Patmos sent visionary messages to Christians in seven cities of western Asia Minor. These messages would eventually become part of the New Testament canon, as The Book of Revelation. What was John's message? What was its literary form? Did he write to a persecuted minority or to Christians enjoying the social and material benefits of the Roman Empire? In search of answers to these penetrating questions, Thompson critically examines the language, literature, history, and social setting of the Book of the Apocalypse. Following a discussion of the importance of the genre apocalypse, he closely analyzes the form and structure of the Revelation, its narrative and metaphoric unity, the world created through John's visions, and the social conditions of the empire in which John wrote. He offers an unprecedented interpretation of the role of boundaries in Revelation, a reassessment of the reign of the Emperor Domitian, and a view of tribulation that integrates the literary vision of Revelation with the reality of the lives of ordinary people in a Roman province. Throughout his study, Thompson argues that the language of Revelation joins the ordinary to the extra-ordinary, earth to heaven, and local conditions to supra-human processes.<br></p><p>Leonard L.

In the first 13 chapters of Critical Incidents, the authors present and examine individual approaches to group therapy. It is then in Chapters 14 and 15 that the authors introduce the idea of systemic therapy. Building upon that foundation, SYSTEMIC GROUP THERAPY looks at the systemic nature of groups within the framework of General Systems Theory. This presentation of the interactive nature of systemic groups helps to demystify the group process. When combined with CRITICAL INCIDENTS IN GROUP THERAPY by Jerry Donigian and Diana Hulse-Killacky, students will be provided with the sum and substance for a course in group therapy/counseling. Not only are students offered the concepts they need to know, instructors will be stimulated to show how these group concepts can be brought to life in their classes.</p><p>Dr. Jeremiah Donigian received his Ed.D. from the Pennsylvania State University and has been with SUNY Brockport's Counselor Education program since 1970.

It's an approach that, over the past four decades, has made him richest man in America and the third-richest man in the world, and that has earned vast fortunes for his business partners and investors. But as Buffett himself will tell you, at the heart of any wealth-building system there are certain core beliefs, not just about finance, but about business, work, morality, your responsibility to yourself, your family and society, and about living a decent life.

They soon began to learn about business, and found that they could help others around the world with their own growing businesses, as well. Along the way, they learned a lot of good lessons not just about business, but about growing as successful people. When the kids came to me to ask for advice, I gave them ideas which I had learned myself over the years and seen had helped others to be successful as well. Sometimes I asked friends of mine to come and be a part of the stories. They were always smart people with their own valuable lessons to teach . . . Jay-Z and Shaquille O'Neal and Kelly Rowland and Nick Cannon . . . even Bill Gates came along on one of our adventures. </p><p>Almost always, the members learned very simple principles and concepts. We have found that these simple principles not only helped them and their businesses to be successful, but helped them to grow and mature as people and citizens of the community. They include lessons on borrowing and loaning money. On choosing partners and good managers. On the importance of always trying new ideas, and saving money, of course.

That&#x2019;s taught as fact in psychology textbooks, academic journals, and bestselling books. And these hardwired differences explain everything from sexual orientation to gender identity, to why there aren&#x2019;t more women physicists or more stay-at-home dads. </p><p> </p><p> In this compelling book, <b>Rebecca Jordan-Young</b> takes on the evidence that sex differences are hardwired into the brain. Analyzing virtually all published research that supports the claims of &#x201c;human brain organization theory,&#x201d; Jordan-Young reveals how often these studies fail the standards of science. Even if careful researchers point out the limits of their own studies, other researchers and journalists can easily ignore them because brain organization theory just sounds so right. But if a series of methodological weaknesses, questionable assumptions, inconsistent definitions, and enormous gaps between ambiguous findings and grand conclusions have accumulated through the years, then science isn&#x2019;t scientific at all. </p><p> </p><p> Elegantly written, this book argues passionately that the analysis of gender differences deserves far more rigorous, biologically sophisticated science. &#x201c;The evidence for hormonal sex differentiation of the human brain better resembles a hodge-podge pile than a solid structure...Once we have cleared the rubble, we can begin to build newer, more scientific stories about human development.&#x201d; </p></p><p>Rebecca M. Jordan-Young is a sociomedical scientist and an Assistant Professor of Women&#x2019;s Studies at Barnard College, Columbia University.I'm the ideal test reader for <i>Brain Storm</i>. I've always had reservations about the sweeping claims that there are fundamental differences in the organization of male and female brains, caused by prenatal hormones. But the sheer number of published studies that seemed to give incontrovertible evidence led me to assume that the theory was sound. This elegantly written and fascinating book has changed my mind. Jordan-Young's comprehensive analysis of the array of conflicting results and methodological weaknesses shows that we have closed the book on this topic far too soon. Her warning is one that all scientists can agree with: Careful! (Lisa Diamond, author of <i>Sexual Fluidity</i>)<br><br>This important and intellectually powerful book shows that a dominant paradigm in human sex differences is held together by chewing gum. By painstakingly examining a large and contradictory literature, Jordan-Young shows the weakness of the brain organization hypothesis. She has so much respect for the scientific method that she can hope that reason and integrity will help create a better, more empirically sound theory of sex differences, and she reaches out to scientists to offer a glimpse of a new psychobiology. (Anne Fausto-Sterling, author of <i>Myths of Gender</i>)<br><br>This is a book of remarkable depth that sets a new standard for clear scientific thinking about complex behavioral traits, as well as for interdisciplinary scholarship. Rebecca Jordan-Young charts a fresh new course through the morass of questions about gender and sexuality with enviable humor, fairness, and intellectual power. (Evan Balaban, McGill University)<br><br><i>Brain Storm</i> poses the most comprehensive challenge yet to the claim that prenatal hormone exposure permanently structures the brain to be either masculine or feminine, and does so in a highly engaging, fair-minded narrative that is a delight to read. (Stephen J. Ceci and Wendy M. Williams, Cornell University)<br><br>Jordan-Young has written a stunning book that demolishes most of the science associated with the dominant paradigm of the development of sex and gender identity, behavior, and orientation. The current paradigm, brain organization theory, proposes: "Because of early exposure to different sex hormones, males and females have different brains"; and these hormones also create "gay" and "straight" brains. Jordan-Young interviewed virtually every major researcher in the field and reviewed hundreds of published scientific papers. Her conclusion: "Brain organization theory is little more than an elaboration of longstanding folk tales about antagonistic male and female essences and how they connect to antagonistic male and female natures." She explains, in exquisite detail, the flaws in the underlying science, from experimental designs that make no statistical sense to "conceptually sloppy" definitions of male and female sexuality, contradictory results, and the social construction of normality. Her conclusion that the patterns we see are far more complicated than previously believed and due to a wider range of variables will shake up the research community and alter public perception. (<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i> 2010-07-12)<br><br>A carefully researched volume that exposes the problems with the widely accepted idea that gender differences are created by certain hormones in the womb. (Alex Spanko <i>Boston Globe</i> 2010-09-21)<br><br>What Jordan-Young's analysis uncovered is by turns fascinating and appalling...This book is not only a tonic, it's also full of scientific insights presented in plain, intelligent prose--an absorbing read, if you've ever wondered what was going on in the secret parts of your attic. (Sara Lippincott <i>Los Angeles Times</i> 2010-10-03)<br><br>It was with appreciation verging on glee that I read Barnard professor Rebecca Jordan-Young's devastatingly smart and definitive critique: <i>Brain Storm: The Flaws in the Science of Sex Differences</i>. Jordan-Young argues that the science of prenatal hormones, gender, and the mind "better resembles a hodgepodge pile than a solid structure." And she knows of what she speaks. An expert on measures and study designs, Jordan-Young has spent the last 13 years combing the literature on brain organization, unpacking assumptions, questioning methods and statistical practices, holding one paper up against another. She stresses that fetal hormones must matter to the brain--somehow. But after picking apart more than 400 studies that try to understand the genesis of particular psychological sex differences (real or supposed), she concludes that fetal T looks like an awfully anemic explanation...After decades of determined research, if robust links between prenatal hormones and "male" or "female" minds really exist, shouldn't we see those links across lots of different kinds of studies? This matters because the obsession with prenatal T can easily become a distraction. It can make us forget how much gender norms have changed--think of all those female accountants, lawyers, and doctors who weren't around 50 or even 30 years ago--and how remarkably similar men's and women's brains and minds actually are. All this unwarranted hammering away at difference (and its putative explanations) causes real trouble, too. As a growing body of research shows, cues that foreground gender and bring stereotypes to mind can dampen men's performance on tests of social sensitivity, women's scores on math tests, and women's stated interest in quantitative pursuits. Jordan-Young has done an enormous amount of work to untangle the gender claims. We ought to read her, cite her, thank her. And then, let's move on. (Amanda Schaffer <i>Slate</i> 2010-10-21)<br><br>Jordan-Young ferret[s] out exaggerated, unreplicated claims and other silliness regarding research on sex differences. The book [is] strongest in exposing research conclusions that are closer to fiction than science. (Diane F. Halpern <i>Science</i> 2010-12-03)<br><br>Exhaustively analyses every relevant study on hormonal sex differentiation of the human brain, and argues that they are riddled with weaknesses, inconsistencies and ambiguity.

Intended for individual study as well as class use, Geoff Barton's guide:</p><p>- clearly introduces the context of the novel and its author;<br>- examines in detail its themes, characters and structure;<br>- looks at the novel in the author's own words, and at different critical receptions;<br>- provides glossaries and test questions to prompt deeper thinking.</p><p>In one of the most memorable novels of recent years, Kazuo Ishiguro imagines the lives of a group of students growing up in a darkly skewed version of contemporary England. Narrated by Kathy, now thirty-one, <i>Never Let Me Go </i>hauntingly dramatises her attempts to come to terms with her childhood at a seemingly idyllic school, Hailsham, and with the fate that has always awaited her and her closest friends in the wider world. A story of love, friendship and memory, <i>Never Let Me Go</i> is charged throughout with a sense of the fragility of life.</p></p><p>All children should believe they are special. But the students of Hailsham, an elite school in the English countryside, are so special that visitors shun them, and only by rumor and the occasional fleeting remark by a teacher do they discover their unconventional origins and strange destiny. Kazuo Ishiguro's sixth novel, <i>Never Let Me Go</i>, is a masterpiece of indirection. Like the students of Hailsham, readers are "told but not told" what is going on and should be allowed to discover the secrets of Hailsham and the truth about these children on their own.<p> Offsetting the bizarreness of these revelations is the placid, measured voice of the narrator, Kathy H., a 31-year-old Hailsham alumna who, at the close of the 1990s, is consciously ending one phase of her life and beginning another. She is in a reflective mood, and recounts not only her childhood memories, but her quest in adulthood to find out more about Hailsham and the idealistic women who ran it. Although often poignant, Kathy's matter-of-fact narration blunts the sharper emotional effects you might expect in a novel that deals with illness, self-sacrifice, and the severe restriction of personal freedoms. As in Ishiguro's best-known work, <i>The Remains of the Day</i>, only after closing the book do you absorb the magnitude of what his characters endure. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>From the Booker Prize-winning author of The Remains of the Day and When We Were Orphans, comes an unforgettable edge-of-your-seat mystery that is at once heartbreakingly tender and morally courageous about what it means to be human. <br>Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it. <br>Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it's only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is. <br>Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Electric Circuits</h2><p><p><b></b> <i>Electric Circuits, Seventh Edition</i> features a redesigned art program, a new four-color format, and 75% new or revised problems throughout.

Highlighting not just the usual terms of presidential administrations and congressional activities, this book provides readers with a "bottom-to-top" perspective, giving voice to our nation's minorities and letting the stories of such groups as African American, women, Native Americans, and the laborers of all nationalities be told in their own words. </p><p> Challenging traditional interpretations of U.S. history, <i>The Twentieth Century </i> is the book for readers interested in gaining a more realistic and complete picture of our world.</p></p><p>Consistently lauded for its lively, readable prose, <i>A People's History of the United States</i> turns traditional textbook history on its head, as Howard Zinn infuses the often-submerged voices of blacks, women, American Indians, war resisters, and poor laborers of all nationalities into the narrative. <i>The Twentieth Century</i> uses the relevant chapters of that book as a starting point, expanding upon the story to provide a rich portrait of the United States from the jingoistic rise of Theodore Roosevelt to the Clinton presidency. If your last experience of American history was brought to you by junior-high-school textbooks--or even if you're a specialist--get ready for the other side of stories you may not even have heard. With its vivid descriptions of rarely noted events, <i>The Twentieth Century</i> is required reading for anyone who wants to take a fresh look at America's legacy as a world power.<p>Howard Zinn has taught history and political science at Spelman College in Atlanta and at Boston University, where he is now professor emeritus. He is the author of <i>A People's Hitory of the United States</i> and has written or edited ten other books.

The most wide-ranging dictionary of its kind, it features 2,800 clear, concise, up-to-date, and fully cross-referenced entries, including many biographical entries for key thinkers, teachers, and scholars. Its detailed appendices include maps, a useful pronunciation guide, a chronology, a list of principal sources, suggestions for further reading, and links to relevant websites. With accurate and easy-to-understand definitions that cover everything from the origins of the religion to Hinduism in the modern world, this dictionary is essential for students and teachers of Hinduism, theology, Asian studies, or philosophy, as well as the related disciplines of history, sociology, and anthropology. It is also a valuable source of information for all practicing Hindus and for anyone with an interest in Indian religions and culture.<br></p><p><br><strong>William Johnson</strong> is Senior Lecturer in Religious Studies, Cardiff University.<br>Hindu literature has a language all its own, consisting of countless terms derived largely from Sanskrit (an ancient language of India). This dictionary of almost 2,800 terms is certainly geared toward the uninitiated&#x2014;those who do not know a dhvaja (&#x201c;banner&#x201d;) from a dvarapala (&#x201c;doorkeeper&#x201d;). Pronouncing terms like these is made easier with diacritical marks throughout and a pronunciation guide in the back. At least half of the terms are proper names describing things such as people (ancient and modern), places, and Hindu subgroups. The average entry is a transliterated Sanskrit term with a one- or two-word translation and a reasonably full explanation of its significance to the religion. Needless to say, the majority of the entries will not be found in other dictionaries&#x2014;not even religious ones. Editor Johnson (Cardiff University) is well credentialed and even served as the translator of Oxford&#x2019;s edition of the Bhagavad Gita (a classic Hindu text). The definitions he provides in the dictionary are concise, yet many are more than a full paragraph in length. He provides a heavy dose of cross-references as well. The volume concludes with a four-page chronology and a nine-page list of sources for further reading. The bibliography represents a balance between primary Hindu texts (translated into English) and secondary sources on several different strands of Hinduism. Highly recommended for public and academic collections with a substantial focus on religion. --Wade Osburn</p><h2>The Social Animal</h2><p>A landmark text that maintains its relevance and unique approach edition after edition, <i>The Social Animal</i> offers a brief, compelling introduction to modern social psychology.

The key expert witness against Irving was the historian Richard J. Evans who describes here, in a book which several publishers have been intimidated into withdrawing, his involvement in the case. Recounting his discovery of Irving's connections with far-right Holocaust deniers in the United States and of how Irving falsified the documentary evidence on the Second World War, Evans reflects generally and eloquently on the interaction of historical and legal rules of evidence.<br>Evans argues that the Irving trial does for the twenty-first century what the Eichmann trial did for the second half of the twentieth.

He in his most vigorous manhood had the liveliness of a youth which will, I believe, accompany him into his old age. His forehead, built for thinking, was the seat of indestructible serenity and joy, talk rich in ideas issued from his lips, joking, humor and wit were at his disposal, and his teaching lectures were the most amusing concourse....Every new discovery he assessed, and he always returned to the genuine knowledge of nature and to the moral value of man. The history of man, of peoples, and of nature, mathematics, and experience were the founts from which he enlivened his lectures and his conversation; nothing worth knowing left him indifferent....This man whom I name with the greatest gratitude and respect is Immanuel Kant."<br><br> --J.G.

Thus begins the history of a generation of Polish literati born at the <i>fin de si�cle</i>. They sat in Caf� Ziemianska and believed that the world moved on what they said there. <i>Caviar and Ashes</i> tells the story of the young avant-gardists of the early 1920s who became the radical Marxists of the late 1920s. They made the choice for Marxism before Stalinism, before socialist realism, before Marxism meant the imposition of Soviet communism in Poland. It ended tragically.<br>Marci Shore begins with this generation&#x2019;s coming of age after the First World War and narrates a half-century-long journey through futurist manifestos and proletarian poetry, Stalinist terror and Nazi genocide, a journey from the literary caf�s to the cells of prisons and the corridors of power.

Forster. Both are stories of extreme contrasts&#x2014;in values, social class and cultural perspectives. Romantic relationships lead to conventional happiness in the delightful social comedy <i>A Room with a View</i>, and to unexpected scandal in the richer, deeply moving novel <i>Howards End</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Howards End</i>, which rivals <i>A Passage to India</i> as Forster&#x2019;s greatest work, makes a country house in Hertfordshire the center and the symbol for what Lionel Trilling called a class war about who would inherit England. Commerce clashes with culture, greed with gentility.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>A Room with a View</i> brings home the stuffiness of upper-middle-class Edwardian society in a tremendously funny comedy that pairs a well-bred young lady with a lusty railway clerk and satirizes both the clergy and the English notion of respectability.<br> &nbsp;<br> Quintessentially British, these two novels have become twentieth-century classics.

With King&#x2019;s he had a lifelong connection and was elected to an Honorary Fellowship in 1946. He declared that his life as a whole had not been dramatic, and he was unfailingly modest about his achievements. Interviewed by the BBC on his eightieth birthday, he said: &#x2018;I have not written as much as I&#x2019;d like to . . . I write for two reasons: partly to make money and partly to win the respect of people whom I respect . . . I had better add that I am quite sure I am not a great novelist.&#x2019; Eminent critics and the general public have judged otherwise and in his obituary <b>The Times</b> called him &#x2018;one of the most esteemed English novelists of his time&#x2019;.<p>He wrote six novels, four of which appeared before the First World War, <b>Where Angels Fear to Tread</b> (1905), <b>The Longest Journey</b> (1907), <b>A Room with a View</b> (1908), and <b>Howard&#x2019;s End</b> (1910).

Around 1585 William joined an acting troupe on tour in Stratford from London, and thereafter spent much of his life in the capital. A member of the leading theatre group in London, the Chamberlain&#39;s Men, which built the Globe Theatre and frequently performed in front of Queen Elizabeth I, Shakespeare wrote 36 plays and much poetry besides. He died in 1616.<br>"State-of-the-art scholarship...has come to stand as the edition of record of Shakespeare's poems and plays."--<em>San Diego Union-Tribune</em><p></p><br>"Includes stage directions, introductions, and a trove of other scholarly goodies.

Yet many of the problems people bring to therapy are linked with or manifested in the body--such as obesity, psychosomatic distress, chronic tension, and sexual problems. This book provides a therapeutic approach that addresses both the physical and mental nature of clients.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In this book, James Kepner shows that a client's posture, movements, and bodily experiences are indeed relevant to therapy, and he offers an insightful framework for incorporating these aspects into a therapeutic framework. This comprehensive treatment explains how body work can be integrated with the aims, methods, and philosophy of psychotherapy, offering a framework within which practitioners of different theoretical approaches can better appreciate body processes in the context of the whole person, rather than as isolated events.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>This book, including an updated introduction by the author, explores the range of body work in psychotherapy, from the development of body awareness to intensive work with physical structure and expression. And it demonstrates how this approach can be particularly effective with a range of clients, including survivors of sexual abuse, recovering drug addicts or alcoholics, or those suffering from chronic illness.</p><p>James I. Kepner, Ph.D., is co-founder and chair of the advanced training program Working with Physical Process as the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland.&nbsp; A pioneer in clinical work with the embodiment of experience, he teaches this work widely around the world.&nbsp; Kepner's own clinical grounding is supplemented by training in a wide range of healing arts.&nbsp; He is also the author of <em>Healing Tasks: Psychotherapy with Adult Survivors of Childhood Abuse</em>.<p>"I was first introduced to the important work of Jim Kepner by Tom Cutolo, Rubenfeld Synergist and Colleague.&nbsp; <em>Body Process</em> is a must for all professionals who want to understand and experience the body's role in psychotherapy from a truly holistic perspective.&nbsp; Bravo!"</p> <p>- Ilana Rubenfeld, founder and creator of the Rubenfeld Synergy Method</p> <p>"A wonderful introduction to the wisdom of the body in psychotherapy."</p> <p>- Ruella Frank, Ph.D., author, <em>Body of Awareness</em></p> <p>"A guide to psychophysical process that should be required reading for all massage therapists and other body workers."</p> <p>- Deborah Ullman, editor, <em>The Gendered Field</em></p></p><h2>Interpreting Qualitative Data</h2><p>In this major updating of his bestselling, benchmark text, David Silverman walks the reader through the basics of gathering and analyzing qualitative data.

It will be of interest to final year undergraduates, postgraduates and established researchers who are interested in learning about this exciting new field. The book introduces readers to fundamental concepts in molecular biology and engineering and then explores the two major themes for synthetic biology, namely &#39;bottom-up&#39; and &#39;top-down&#39; engineering approaches. &#39;Top-down&#39; engineering utilises a conceptual framework of engineering and systematic design to build new biological systems by integrating robustly characterised biological parts into an existing system through the use of extensive mathematical modelling. The &#39;bottom-up&#39; approach involves the design and building of synthetic protocells using basic chemical and biochemical building blocks from scratch. Exemplars of cutting-edge applications designed using synthetic biology principles are presented, including the production of novel biofuels from renewable feedstocks, microbial synthesis of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals, and the design and implementation of biosensors to detect infections and environmental waste. The book also uses the Internationally Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition to illustrate the power of synthetic biology as an innovative research and training science. Finally, the primer includes a chapter on the ethical, legal and societal issues surrounding synthetic biology, illustrating the integration of social sciences in synthetic biology research.</p><p><p>&nbsp;In <i>Synthetic Biology</i>, expert researchers in the field provide the latest developments in molecular biology techniques used in Synthetic Biology.&nbsp; Focusing on computational tools that will aid in systematising the design and construction of parts and systems.

With a wide range of media, Kelley's work explores themes as varied as post-punk politics, religious systems, social class, and repressed memory. Using architectural models to represent schools he attended, his 1995 work, <i>Educational Complex</i>, presents forgotten spaces as frames for private trauma, real or imagined. The work's implications are at once miniature and massive. In this book, John Miller offers an illustrated examination of this milestone work that marked a significant change in Kelley's practice.</p><p>A &#x201c;complex&#x201d; can mean an architectural configuration, a psychological syndrome, or a political apparatus, and Miller approaches <i>Educational Complex</i> through corresponding lines of inquiry, considering the making of the work, examining it in terms of education and trauma (sexual or otherwise), and investigating how it tests the ideological horizon of art as an institution. Miller shows that in <i>Educational Complex</i>, Kelley expands his political and aesthetic focus, including not only such artifacts as generic forms of architecture but (inspired by the infamous McMartin Preschool case) popular fantasies associated with ritual sex abuse and false memory syndrome. Through this archaeology of the contemporary, Miller argues, Kelley examines the mandate for education and the liberal democratic premises underpinning it.</p></p><p>John Miller, Professor of Professional Practice in the Department of Art History at Barnard College, is an artist and critic whose work has been exhibited internationally. He was Mike Kelley&#39;s friend and colleague from 1978 until Kelley&#39;s death in 2012.</p><h2>American Higher Education in the Twenty-First Century: Social, Political, and Economic Challenges</h2><p><p>First published in 1998, <i>American Higher Education in the Twenty-First Century</i> offers a comprehensive entree to the central issues facing American colleges and universities today.

Studio jewelers are independent artists in small workshops, directly handling their materials and producing one-of-a-kind pieces that are both decorative object and fine sculpture. As recognition of American studio jewelry has increased in recent years, so has the need for a comprehensive history--and this beautifully designed and lavishly illustrated volume is that book. Featuring over 150 bracelets, brooches, necklaces and rings from the world-renowned Daphne Farago Collection, <i>Studio Jewelry</i> presents the major events, ideas and individuals who shaped the field, and maps its evolution since it emerged within the modern studio craft movement. It also addresses the questions underlying the history of studio jewelry: jewelry as sculpture and personal adornment, the relationship between jewelry and the body, the use of non-traditional materials and the cultural meaning of the pieces. Finally, the book spans the variety of approaches in the field, while offering in-depth discussions of such key artist-jewelers as Alexander Calder, Art Smith, Margaret De Patta, Robert Ebendorf and Gijs Bakker. Much more than the catalogue of an important individual collection, <i>Studio Jewelry</i> is an essential reference work for anyone creating, teaching or collecting in the field of studio jewelry today.</p><p></p><h2>The Leader in Me: How Schools and Parents Around the World Are Inspiring Greatness, One Child At a Time</h2><p><b>From the multimillion-copy bestselling author of <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i>, Dr. Stephen R. Covey illustrates how his principles of leadership can be applied to children of all ages. </b><br><br>In today&#x2019;s world, we are inundated with information about who to be, what to do, and how to live. But what if there was a way to learn not just what to think about, but how to think? A program that taught young people how to manage priorities, focus on goals, and be a positive influence in their schools?<br> <br><i>The Leader in Me</i> is that program. In this bestseller, Stephen R. Covey took the <i>7 Habits</i> that have already changed the lives of millions of readers and showed that even young children can use them as they develop. These habits are being adapted by schools around the country in leadership programs, most famously at the A.B Combs Elementary school in Raleigh. Not only do the programs work, but they work better than anyone could have imagined. This book is full of examples of how the students blossom under the program&#x2014;from the classroom that decided to form a support group for one of their classmates who had behavioral problems to the fourth grader who overcame his fear of public speaking and took his class to see him compete in a national story telling competition.<br> <br>Perfect for individuals and corporations alike, <i>The Leader in Me</i> shows how easy it is to incorporate these skills into daily life so kids of all ages can be more effective, goal-oriented, and successful.</p><p>Recognized as one of <i>Time</i> magazine&#x2019;s twenty-five most influential Americans, Stephen R. Covey (1932&#x2013;2012) was an internationally respected leadership authority, family expert, teacher, organizational consultant, and author.&nbsp;His books have sold more than twenty-five million copies&nbsp;in thirty-eight languages, and <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> was named the #1 Most Influential Business Book of the Twentieth Century. After receiving an MBA from Harvard and a doctorate degree from Brigham Young University, he became the cofounder and vice chairman of FranklinCovey, a leading global training firm.<b></b><p><b> Foreword </b> </p><p> As much as any professional work I have embarked upon, this book comes from my heart. It both thrills and humbles me like you cannot imagine. </p><p> It involves today's young people. It involves our future. Whether you are a concerned parent, a professional educator, or a foresighted business leader, I am confident you will find it to be an invigorating breath of fresh air, a reason to celebrate and an inspiring call for action. For what you are about to read unveils a budding trend that is gaining momentum in a growing number of schools across the United States and in various parts of the world. It is an exciting trend -- one that is producing tangible, sustainable results. </p><p> From the get-go, I want you to know that I am not the mastermind behind the trend. Rather, credit goes to an expanding community of committed, creative, and caring professional educators who have synergistically joined forces with parents, civic leaders, and business proprietors to bring about a new level of hope in education. </p><p> To set the context, let me take you back a few years to what seems like yesterday. In 1989, <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> was published. Its subtitle was "Restoring the Character Ethic." The book caught a wave that even I had no way of anticipating, particularly in organizational arenas. Today, the <i>7 Habits</i> are still thriving in boardrooms, government offices, and corporate universities around the globe. </p><p> About the same time as the <i>7 Habits</i> book was launched, I was approached by Chuck Farnsworth, who at the time was superintendent of schools for a progressive district in Indiana. Chuck felt strongly that the <i>7 Habits</i> had an important role to play in the world of education, and he was passionately determined to lead the charge. He began by taking the habits to school administrators and teachers. To date, nearly a half million professional educators have been trained in the <i>7 Habits</i>, with many of them being certified as school facilitators. </p><p> As we brought the <i>7 Habits</i> into schools, the focus remained on training adults, not students. That changed in 1998, when my son, Sean, wrote <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens</i>. Sean had been a Division I college football quarterback, which created frequent opportunities for him to be in front of teen audiences. He developed a sincere interest in young people that eventually propelled him to write the teen version. More than three million teen copies have now been sold, and Student Activity Guides have carried the habits to over a hundred thousand middle and high school students. </p><p> In the latter part of 1999, the <i>7 Habits</i> made another significant entry into schools. During a presentation in Washington, D.C., I was approached by an elementary school principal named Muriel Summers. She wanted to know if I thought the <i>7 Habits</i> could be taught to young children. I pointed her toward Sean's book, but she came back with the reply that she was referring to <i>very young</i> children -- as young as five years old. I responded, "I don't know why not," and then casually added that if she ever tried to do it to let me know how it went. </p><p> This book contains the account of what Muriel and her talented staff initiated following that brief encounter. It is a tremendous story, one that has been simmering, thickening, rippling, and gaining momentum (and even some notoriety) for some time, as the percentage of students achieving end-of-grade targets has gone from 84 to 97 percent and the school has gone from the brink of nearly being terminated as a magnet school to being named the number one magnet school in America. How? With great success they, and now scores of other schools, have been teaching the <i>7 Habits</i> and other leadership principles to elementary school students -- yes, even five-year-olds. Their approach is unique and may even surprise you. Their intent has not been to prepare students to become CEOs or world leaders, but rather to teach them how to lead their individual lives and how to succeed in the twenty-first century. I believe you will discover in their approach some highly credible and principle-based solutions to some of the most discouraging dilemmas facing schools today. </p><p> In approaching the topic of education, I am keenly aware that today's educators are constantly under a microscope and have been the targets of abundant negative press in recent years. Such is not the intent of this book. Rather than being a critic, I prefer to promote the good. I honestly believe that it is difficult to spend time in most any school these days without departing in absolute reverence of some incredible teachers -- noble mentors who have sacrificed much to do what they love and what they believe will make a difference in young lives. To focus only on the negative in education while ignoring what the true heroes are doing would be a tragic act of ingratitude. </p><p> Some may view my efforts as self-serving. I acknowledge why some might feel that way, but I am willing to risk that perception because I so strongly believe in what these schools are doing for today's young people. Indeed, it is the profound successes that these schools are having that has inspired Franklin Covey to devote more of its mission toward partnering with schools, businesses, parents, and community leaders to create resources that will better enable young people to prepare for the world that awaits them -- a world that none of us can fully predict. Likewise, it was the successes of these schools that ignited Sean's desire to write his recently released book, <i>The 7 Habits of Happy Kids</i>. Both this book and Sean's book -- along with a whole series of new <i>The Leader in Me</i> resources and website materials -- are vital components in FranklinCovey's effort to do more toward the betterment of societies and young people of all nations. </p><p> This book represents the combined efforts of many people. My partner, Boyd Craig, provided visionary leadership and direction to the entire team and project. Dr. David K. Hatch shepherded the research efforts with passion, dedication, and world class character and competence. He took my heart, put data behind it, and helped me transfer it to paper. Their efforts were competently supported by Franklin Covey's Education Solutions team, in particular Sarah Noble, Connie Spencer, Aaron Ashby, Sean Covey, Judy Yauch, Shawn Moon, and Stephanie Calton, and such road-tested consultants as Dr. Nancy Moore, Dr. Jane Knight, Gary McGuey, and Lonnie Moore, as well as Dr. Craig Pace and Dr. Dean Collinwood, who conducted early research for the book. Others such as Victoria Marrott contributed significant administrative support. The rest of my office team -- Julie Gillman, Chelsea Johns, and Darla Salin -- provide constant support to all of my work. More important, well over a hundred teachers, school superintendents, principals, parents, professors, and school board members volunteered extensive input and rigorous review of the work. Their practical, tried-and-refined insights substantiate each page. My heartfelt gratitude extends to all who participated. </p><p> To gain a quick overview of what this book entails, I suggest that you skim through it from front to back while looking at the pictures and reading their captions. I also recommend that you visit TheLeaderInMeBook.org online to view video clips of schools and activities spoken of in this book. </p><p> As you view the various resources and traverse the pages of this book, I hope you feel my deep, personal commitment, and behind it all my firm belief in the potential of today's young people. As a grandparent, I am delighted with the possibilities this book may create for my grandchildren, their children, and eventually their children's children. I think nothing but the highest of them and want nothing short of the best for them. Likewise, as a global citizen, I feel a vested interest in the progress, well-being, and happiness of all young people. They are the society and hope of the future -- <i>our</i> future -- and I firmly desire that future to be in good hands. Finally, as a business executive, I want to be able to look into the eyes of today's young people and see a vibrant coming workforce, a pool of future leaders who are well prepared for the challenges that we all know lie ahead. </p><p> Indeed, it is my sincerest hope that this book will somehow spread its figurative wings and soar with a reach that will truly make a difference in the lives of young people the world over -- now and for generations to come. </p><p> Stephen R.

Migration is an enigma. Who knows why the cuckoo, born in Europe, flies alone to the far forests of Africa, home of its ancestors? Or how the Arctic tern can fly over ten thousand miles on its astonishing journey from pole to pole? Winged Migration follows single birds and whole squadrons on their restless flights seeking answers to such riddles. The result is a tour de force that is testament to the patience of a globe-trotting team of filmmakers and ornithologists. With its informative text, <i>Winged Migration</i> offers both the general reader and the dedicated bird watcher a bird's-eye view of five continents and a grand, yet intimate, portrait of the secret life of birds.</p><p>Jacques Perrin , producer of the internationally successful film Microcosmos, produced the documentary film Winged Migration.From the makers of the Oscar-nominated documentary film Winged Migration comes this companion volume of photographs and essays on the rituals and travels of birds. Perrin, the documentary's producer, and Mongibeaux, a special correspondent for Figaro magazine, take a broad, poetic approach to their subject, peppering their work with dramatic lines like "as soon as spring comes, the birds obey, each in their own way, the same law that their ancestors have obeyed since the dawn of time." Though the book overflows with "Feathered Facts" and substantial essays by practicing ornithologists, its tone leans more toward celebration than scientific detachment. The result is an unusually passionate survey of entire class of animals, illustrated with stunning film stills and photographs. There are two-page spreads showing Canada geese flying over the deserts of Arizona and close-ups of pink flamingos in Kenya. Fans of the film will appreciate the book's last section, which explains how the filmmakers used ultra-light miniature aircraft and "bird actors" to document the migration routes of several species. A beautiful tribute to the animal kingdom's diversity and adaptability, this volume should appeal to both birders and armchair travelers. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jarndyce&#x2014;a dispute over a vast fortune left by a miser who died intestate&#x2014;has occupied the Court of Chancery for years. When Lady Dedlock faints upon recognizing the handwriting in one of the documents pertaining to the case, her sinister lawyer, Tulkinghorn, immediately suspects a hidden secret, and an opportunity for blackmail&#x2014;but he is playing a dangerous game, and is soon found dead: a victim of murder. It is down to Detective Inspector Bucket to solve the mystery. Dickens was fascinated by the sensational crime cases of his day. His preoccupations&#x2014;with crime and the legal system, with social injustice&#x2014;are dramatically evident in <i>Bleak House</i>: at once a classic crime novel and a classic of world literature.</p><p><i>Bleak House</i> is a satirical look at the Byzantine legal system in London as it consumes the minds and talents of the greedy and nearly destroys the lives of innocents--a contemporary tale indeed. Dickens's tale takes us from the foggy dank streets of London and the maze of the Inns of Court to the peaceful countryside of England. Likewise, the characters run from murderous villains to virtuous girls, from a devoted lover to a "fallen woman," all of whom are affected by a legal suit in which there will, of course, be no winner. The first-person narrative related by the orphan Esther is particularly sweet. The articulate reading by the acclaimed British actor Paul Scofield, whose distinctive broad English accent lends just the right degree of sonority and humor to the text, brings out the color in this classic social commentary disguised as a Victorian drama. However, to abridge Dickens is, well, a Dickensian task, the results of which make for a story in which the author's convoluted plot lines and twists of fate play out in what seems to be a fast-forward format. Listeners must pay close attention in order to keep up with the multiple narratives and cast of curious characters, including the memorable Inspector Bucket and Mr. Guppy. Fortunately, the publisher provides a partial list of characters on the inside jacket. (<i>Running time: 3 hours; 2 cassettes</i>)Founded in 1906 by J.M.

The benefits, even in achieving greater justice, of individual instances of corruption, especially against a background pattern of bribery, make the problem of corruption essentially an issue of public good versus individual benefit. But Rose-Ackerman gives accounts of successful programs of ending or massively reducing varied forms of corruption.

He spoke on the eve of America&#x2019;s entrance into World War I, just as Russia teetered between autocracy and democracy. In the face of chaos and turmoil in Europe, Wilson was determined to move America away from the isolationism that had defined the nation&#x2019;s foreign policy since its inception and to embrace an active role in shaping world affairs.</p><p>Just ten days later, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated the Russian throne, ending a three-centuries-long dynasty and plunging his country into a new era of uncertainty, ultimately paving the way for the creation of a Soviet empire.</p><p>Within a few short weeks, at Wilson&#x2019;s urging, Congress voted to declare war on Germany, asserting the United States&#x2019; new role as a global power and its commitment to spreading American ideals abroad. Yet at home it remained a Jim Crow nation, and African Americans had their own struggle to pursue. American women were agitating for the vote and a greater role in society, and labor strife was rampant. As a consequence of the war that followed, the United States and Russia were to endure a century of wariness and hostility that flickers and flares to this day.</p><p><em>March 1917</em> reexamines these tumultuous events and their consequences in a compelling new analysis. Drawing on a wealth of contemporary Russian and American diaries, memoirs, oral histories, and newspaper accounts, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist Will Englund creates a highly detailed and textured account of the month that transformed the world&#x2019;s greatest nations. <em>March 1917</em> considers the dreams of that year&#x2019;s warriors, pacifists, activists, revolutionaries, and reactionaries, and demonstrates how their successes and failures constitute the origin story of our complex modern world.</p> 8 pages of illustrations</p><p>Pulitzer, Polk, and Overseas Press Club Award&#x2013;winning journalist Will Englund was a recent Moscow correspondent for The Washington Post and has spent a total of twelve years reporting from Russia.

More people than ever are reading and discussing his writings. But Nietzsche's ideas are often overshadowed by the myths and rumors that surround his sex life, his politics, and his sanity. In this lively and comprehensive analysis, Nietzsche scholars Robert C. Solomon and Kathleen M. Higgins get to the heart of Nietzsche's philosophy, from his ideas on "the will to power" to his attack on religion and morality and his infamous <i>�bermensch</i> (superman).<br><b>What Nietzsche Really Said</b> offers both guidelines and insights for reading and understanding this controversial thinker. Written with sophistication and wit, this book provides an excellent summary of the life and work of one of history's most provocative philosophers.</p><p>Kathleen Higgins and Robert Solomon's comprehensive, lucid, and often humorous overview of Nietzsche's philosophy sings with the joy of his own work--a joy, the authors point out, that is often misunderstood or overlooked. Central to Nietzsche's thought is the call to celebrate life for its own sake. Yet, as Nietzsche himself realized, this often requires provocation. Through both the style and substance of his work, Nietzsche sought to inspire heated dialogue, encouraging readers "to say yes to philosophy, and to life." Many factors get in the way of recognizing and rising to the challenge, however--not the least of which are the rumors surrounding his life, work, and sympathies; his provocative views and prose; and his vivid attacks on systems of thought and individuals. With sense and sensitivity, Higgins and Solomon, both philosophy professors at the University of Texas at Austin, debunk 30 common rumors, offer questions to help guide our reading, provide brief annotations of Nietzsche's works, and examine his heroes and nemeses (sometimes the same people). In addition, they thoughtfully assess concepts central to Nietzsche's philosophy, including those critical to his "affirmative philosophy." This thorough approach, combined with clear writing and a sense of playfulness (attributes Nietzsche would have appreciated), offers insight into Nietzsche's philosophy without sacrificing its nuance or power--a substantial gift, indeed. <i>--Stephanie Wickersham</i>"Solomon and Higgins have put together a survival kit for those intending an expedition into Nietzsche territory, a refresher course for those who have been there, a map of the danger spots, and an encyclopedia of the main wonders.

Describes many examples and analogies that are &#39;portable&#39; from field to field of applications. Deals with designs that are the primary basis of research studies, but are neglected in most statistical textbooks (which tend to concentrate on statistical analysis). Takes a broader, more general and philosophical view of the statistics for the more fundamental aspects of design than do the standard treatments of experimental design. Carefully organized into seven chapters and 44 sections, this book can be readily consulted by research workers or graduate students. Extensively illustrated.Even before statistical data are collected for research, essential decisions of design must be made, decisions which will have significant effects on the validity and efficiency of studies. Yet virtually the entire literature on statistics addresses concerns of analysis&#x2014;and glosses over the crucial issues of collection and selection, issues that go to the heart of the methods and philosophy of the field. Statistical Design for Research delves into the criteria and decisions that underlie accurate, valid methodology. It pursues the uses and ramifications of three distinct design methods: experimental designs, survey sampling, and controlled investigations. Stressing the importance of the basic choice among these design strategies, the treatment explicates the analytical uses of sample surveys; designs for comparisons; controls for disturbing variables; samples and censuses; sample designs over time; and several distinct problems over time. Throughout, coverage is broad enough to encompass the common considerations in many related fields, including the social sciences, health sciences, education, and market research. It can serve as a textbook for university sources and as a source book for research workers. The text is enhanced by 37 tables and figures, over 50 problems, and a comprehensive list of references, notated to indicate the section where each is cited in the text. By claiming for statistics the usually neglected primary aspects of research design, Statistical Design for Research will produce more accurate, practical, and economical designs for future statistical analysis.</p><h2>The Contemporary Print: From Pre-Pop to Postmodern</h2><p>Today, not only do the best artists of our time frequently make prints, some of the most highly regarded artworks are prints. More editions are being produced by more artists in greater diversity than at any point in history. This book provides for the first time an authoritative critical survey of printed art over the last four decades - an indispensable reference for students, scholars, art professionals, artists, collectors and would-be collectors, examining and illustrating the work of more than 170 artists from 11 countries.<br>Starting from the foundation of Universal Limited Art Editions in 1957, The Contemporary Print explores thoroughly the differing traditions of postwar Europe and America: the brilliant experiments of Johns and Rauschenberg; the Pop explosion; the Multiple; Op art, Minimalism and Serialism; Conceptual artists exploiting the language of photography; the rejection of mechanical slickness in the 1970s; the revival of Expressionism and figuration in the 1980s; and the new energies with which the print continues to influence and intrigue us today, expanding the ways in which we think about art.<br>With a fully detailed catalogue, workshop histories, biographies of all the most prominent artists, and a glossary of print terms, this is a unique and invaluable guide - one of the few essential books for anyone concerned with contemporary art.</p><p>Concentrating on North America and Europe, Tallman, who has written extensively on contemporary art, surveys the history of printmaking from the revival that began in the late 1950s with the establishing of professional collaborative lithographic print shops to current experimental trends that include photography and digital technologies. Her readable text focuses on the works of more than 170 artists and covers the major movements of four decades, including pop, multiples, op, minimalism and photo-realism. The 334 illustrations (161 in color) are aptly chosen, although some of the b&amp;w reproductions do not adequately show all the fine points of works that depend on nuance for effect. Overall, however, this is a masterful treatment of a complex subject, providing a wealth of information about artists, techniques and the relevance of printmaking to late-20th-century culture. Artists' biographies, a history of workshops and publishers, a bibliography and a glossary of terms used in printmaking are included. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Tallman's review of the modern print carries the examination to postmodern times and analyzes the changing traditions of European and American printmaker's processes. From technological influences on changing styles to individual contributions, this provides a catalog which balances history and artistic analysis with fine black and white and full page color print reproductions from a variety of works. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Glencoe Geometry, IL Student Edition (Glencoe Mathematics)</h2><p><b>A flexible program with the solid content students need</b><br><br><i>Glencoe Geometry</i> is the leading geometry program on the market.

As the author blends humor into his discussion of childhood�s impact on adulthood, the listener can hear the smile on Fabry�s face. Leman believes that understanding one�s memories can help one improve one�s self-image, make the most of one�s strengths, and overcome one�s weaknesses. The key is which childhood days are remembered: evaluating the types of memories one returns to is revealing about personality and self-image. Woven into the mix is Leman�s previous writing on birth order. Fabry�s melodious reading makes a thought-provoking topic engaging.

The Viennese artist Lisbeth Zwerger, however, goes a long way toward providing a new and refreshed set of images for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the humbug wizard.

Identifying the factors that promote, or inhibit, successful collective action for an ever-growing set of challenges associated with globalization, Todd Sandler applies them to promoting global health, providing foreign assistance, controlling rogue nations, limiting transnational terrorism, and intervening in civil wars.</p><p>This book explains why the global community has been successful in correcting some recent large-scale problems, but has failed in addressing others. The book discusses challenges drawn from the fields of global health, security, the environment, and governance. The analysis reaches from antiobiotic-resistant microbes to greenhouse gases, from civil wars to international terrorism, and from the polluted atmospheres of cities to the depths of outer space. In the process, the reader learns what ties together seemingly different problems, and what distinguishes seemingly similar concerns. The book is intended for a wide audience drawn from the social and policy sciences.Todd Sandler holds the Robert R. and Katheryn A.

Kenneth Moore, Eve Straussman-Pflanzer, Wendy Thompson, and Jeremy Warren</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many famous Italian Renaissance artworks were made to celebrate love and marriage. They were the pinnacles of a tradition---dating from the early Renaissance---of commemorating betrothal, marriage, and the birth of a child by commissioning extraordinary objects or exchanging them as gifts. This important volume is the first to examine the entire range of works to which Renaissance rituals of love and marriage gave rise and makes a major contribution to our understanding of Renaissance art in its broader cultural context. Some 140 works of art, dating from about 1400 to 1600, are discussed by a distinguished group of scholars and are reproduced in full color.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marriage and childbirth gifts are the point of departure. These range from maiolica, glassware, and jewelry to birth trays, musical instruments, and nuptial portraits. Bonds of love of another sort were represented in erotic drawings and prints. From these precedents, an increasingly inventive approach to subjects of love and marriage culminated in paintings by some of the greatest artists of the Renaissance, including Giulio Romano, Lorenzo Lotto, and Titian. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Andrea Bayer is Curator in the Department of European Paintings at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>Selected as a finalist for the 2010 Alfred H.

McIver <i>Renaissance Quarterly</i>)</p><h2>Plato and the Socratic Dialogue: The Philosophical Use of a Literary Form</h2><p>This book offers a new interpretation of Plato&#39;s early and middle dialogues as the expression of a unified philosophical vision. Whereas the traditional view sees the dialogues as marking successive stages in Plato&#39;s philosophical development, we may more legitimately read them as reflecting an artistic plan for the gradual, indirect and partial exposition of Platonic philosophy. The magnificent literary achievement of the dialogues can be fully appreciated only from the viewpoint of a unitarian reading of the philosophical content.</p><p>This book presents a new paradigm for the interpretation of Plato&#39;s early and middle dialogues as a unified literary project, displaying an artistic plan for the expression of a unified world view. The usual assumption of a distinct &#34;Socratic&#34; period in Plato&#39;s work is rejected. Literary evidence is presented from other Socratic authors to demonstrate that the Socratic dialogue was a genre of literary fiction, not historical biography. Once it is recognized that the dialogue is a fictional form, there is no reason to look for the philosophy of the historical Socrates in Plato&#39;s earlier writings. We can thus read most of the so-called Socratic dialogues proleptically, interpreting them as partial expressions of the philosophical vision more fully expressed in the Phaedo and Republic. Differences between the dialogues are interpreted not as different stages in Plato&#39;s thinking but as different literary moments in the presentation of his thought. This indirect and gradual mode of exposition in the earlier dialogues is the artistic device chosen by Plato to prepare his readers for the reception of a new and radically unfamiliar view of reality: a view according to which the &#34;real world&#34; is an invisible realm, the source of all value and all rational structure, the natural homeland of the human soul."This outstanding work of scholarship issues serious challenges to many of the reigning orthodoxies of Platonic studies....Strongly recommended for its originality and imaginative scholarship." J. Bussanich, Choice<br><br>"...Kahn's book has a great deal to offer besides this central argument. His account of the theory of Forms is subtle and profound. He does full justice to the role of love in Plato's thought." Jasper Griffin, New York Review of Books<br><br>"...quite rewarding." David Sider, American Journal of Philology<br><br>"The fact is that Plato and the Socratic Dialogue is a very interesting book. Its interest lies not in the analysis of methodology but in the nuanced reading of a set of ancient texts that Kahn "offer[s]...[as] a comprehensive interpretation, at once literary, historical, and philosophical, the fruit of a lifetime of reading and teaching Plato" (p. xiii). Kahn does offer a nearly comprehensive interpretation of the early and middle dialpgues. His interpretation is literary, historical, and philosophical. Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, his interpretation brings out some of what is truly awe inspiring about the ancient Greek period and about Plato's contribution to this period of human development." Review of Metaphysics</p><h2>The Practice of Social Research (with CD-ROM and InfoTrac) (Available Titles CengageNOW)</h2><p>This thorough revision of Babbie&#39;s standard-setting book for the course offers students a comprehensive, straightforward introduction to the field of research methods as practiced by sociologists and other social scientists. Emphasizing the importance of the research process, the book shows students how social scientists design research studies, introduces the variety of observation modes used by sociologists, and covers the &#34;how-tos&#34; and &#34;whys&#34; of social research methods. Students learn how to conduct various types of research, when it is appropriate to use each method, and how to analyze qualitative and quantitative data using the Elaboration Model. The 10th edition provides students with the necessary tools for understanding social research methods and for applying these concepts both inside and outside the classroom--as researchers and as consumers of research. Retaining the authoritative coverage of the research process that has made the book a best-seller, the new edition is more student-friendly than ever. The new edition features a completely new chapter on reading and writing social research, a streamlined organization, a new running glossary, and a new Research Writing and Chapter Tutorial CD-ROM that not only helps students every step of the way in writing research papers, but also links to chapter by chapter online tutorials that will help them master the concepts and techniques of the course.</p><p>Earl R.

Yet that understanding has had almost no effect on the way maps are viewed and used by the general public. In <i>The Natures of Maps</i>, cartographers Denis Wood and John Fels present a compelling exploration of a wide range of maps to answer the question of, as they put it, why maps have &#x201c;gotten away with it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To answer that question, the authors turn to a category of maps with a particularly strong reputation for objectivity: maps of nature. From depictions of species habitats and bird migrations to portrayals of the wilds of&nbsp;the Grand Canyon and the reaches of the Milky Way, such maps are usually presumed&#x2014;even by users who should know better&#x2014;to be strictly scientific. Yet by drawing our attention to every aspect of these maps&#x2019; self-presentation, from place names to titles and legends, the authors reveal the way that each piece of information collaborates in a disguised effort to mount an argument about reality. Without our realizing it, those arguments can then come to define our very relationship to the natural world&#x2014;determining whether we see ourselves as humble hikers or rampaging despoilers, participants or observers, consumers or stewards.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richly illustrated, and crafted in vivid and witty prose, <i>The Natures of Maps</i> will enlighten and entertain map aficionados, scholars, and armchair navigators alike. You&#x2019;ll never be able to look at Google Maps quite the same way again.</p><p>Denis Wood is the author of several books, including <i>The Power of Maps</i>. John Fels is Adjunct Associate Professor in the Graduate GIS Program of the College of Natural Resources at North Carolina State University."[The authors] offer up some appealing ideas. Afterwards, even a road map of Kent starts to seem more interesting." (Olivia Edward <i>BBC Focus</i>)<br><br>"Nothing like this has been attempted in cartography before. . . .The book is intelligent <i>and</i> drop-dead gorgeous; turning the project into an art book as well as a theoretical study of maps and nature.. . . . It may be a strength of this [book] that the ramifications are lightly sketched and the theoretical deftly articulated but not hammered in on every page.

Stewart hilts teaches in the Department of Land Resources Science at the Ontario Agricultural College. Peter Mitchell is a research associate on various projects at the Centre for Land &amp; Water Stewardship, University of Guelph. Their approach to woodlot management involves integrating information to deal with real problems, options and opportunities from a landowner perspective while incorporating a strong ecological perspective. </p><p><b> Chapter 1: What This Book Is All About </b></p><p> For fifteen years now, we have been developing programs to help rural landowners understand and care for their properties. We know from this work that rural landowners love their land and are always ready to learn more about it. The single most common group of questions landowners have are related to caring for their woodlands and creating new woodlands by planting trees. </p><p> Some owners want to leave their woods completely alone, to preserve it just for the birds. Others need or want to harvest timber or firewood on an ongoing basis. In between are owners interested in nature study, hiking, hunting, and other activities. Many landowners choose a combination of these relationships with their land. </p><p> As long as the care of your woodland is "sustainable" -- that is, it leaves the woods in healthy ecological condition - we believe that management should be the choice of the landowner. This is why we use the term "stewardship" to refer to this role of landowners. In our view, stewardship simply means the care that private landowners give to their land. It implies some active management based on understanding and an ethical commitment to leave your land in as good condition as, or better than, you found it. </p><p> In this book, we will be reviewing a full range of woodland-management options, from preserving your woodland for nature to sustainable timber harvesting. Management that takes into account this complete range of options is sometimes referred to as "holistic forestry." </p><p><b> Woodland Stewardship </b></p><p> Over the past decade, the science of forest management has changed substantially, from a historic emphasis on timber and some wildlife management to an emphasis on caring for the entire forest as an "ecosystem." </p><p> An "ecosystem" is the sum total of all the factors and components that make up the natural system in a given region. It includes physical factors such as the soil, water, sunlight, nutrients, and energy that enable the system to function. It includes the plants that grow in the area to form a plant community. And it includes the wildlife that lives in the area, from birds to mammals to the millions of insects that we rarely notice. </p><p> Above all, the term "ecosystem" emphasizes the relationships and interactions among all these components. Thus an ecosystem is a complex web of individual parts, all interacting with each other, as we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 2, on woodland ecology. </p><p> A new term closely associated with our understanding of ecosystems is "biodiversity." This term has grown out of international concern for the disappearance of species as humanity eliminates more and more of the remaining natural habitats on the planet. It refers to the complete biological diversity in a region, including: </p><ul> <li>the diversity of plant communities in a landscape,</li> <li>the diversity of species in a community,</li> <li>the diversity of genetic characteristics in a single species, and</li> <li>the genetic traits of an individual organism.</li> </ul> Conservation of biodiversity is now a global priority, another issue to which we will return in the following chapter. <p></p><p> But woodlands have other important functions as well. Conserving water resources is one of the most critical; forest vegetation plays a key role in the hydrological cycle, moderating runoff and minimizing erosion. Woodlands also provide our most important wildlife habitats and are widely used for recreation, to say nothing of their economic value. </p><p> When we speak of ecosystem management, or conservation of biodiversity, we are placing the emphasis on the woodland as a whole, not just the trees and certainly not just those trees that we might harvest for timber. This new emphasis on the big picture -- the entire woodland in all its complexity - is one half of the idea of holistic forestry, or what we refer to as woodland stewardship. It recognizes all the ecological functions that woodlands perform. </p><p> At the same time, people are usually also part of this picture. At least in the landscape of eastern North America, most woodlands are privately owned, and these landowners use their woodlands for a wide range of purposes. These purposes can be described as the values that woodlands provide to society, though you can also argue that they have their own right to exist. </p><p> The values of woodlands are diverse, including: </p><ul> <li>their contribution to the natural beauty of the landscape,</li> <li>the rare species they may shelter,</li> <li>the erosion control and water conservation they provide,</li> <li>the oxygen they produce,</li> <li>the opportunities for recreation they provide, from hunting to nature study, from snowmobiling to cross-country skiing,</li> <li>their role as wildlife habitat,</li> <li>their role in conserving biodiversity,</li> <li>their ability to provide economic return through maple-syrup or firewood production, and</li> <li>their ability to provide a sustainable harvest of timber.</li> </ul><p></p><p> This wide range of values, which can be reflected in our decision making, is the other half of the new emphasis on holistic forestry -- that is, the importance of taking all values into account when making management decisions. </p><p> Holistic forestry, or woodland stewardship as we use the term, is therefore forest management that considers the whole woodland as an ecosystem and all the management options that can be applied, as well as considering the whole range of values that the woodland provides. </p><p><b> Understanding Your Woodland </b></p><p> The first step in choosing among management options is to get to know your woodland. This requires walking through your woods at different times of the year, learning to identify the trees, and also recognizing other features such as streams or wetlands. There is no rush to make decisions; you will gain experience and be able to make better decisions over the years. </p><p> By gathering information about the trees, the other plants, and the wildlife in your woods, you can prepare a description or inventory. This is the first step in developing a management plan. It can also be the start of a much deeper appreciation of your woodland as an ecosystem in all its complexity. </p><p> You can either prepare such a woodland inventory yourself or hire a forest consultant to prepare one for you. Most government programs that support woodland management require the preparation of a basic inventory as the first part of a management plan. In Chapters 3 and 4, we outline the steps to follow in preparing a woodland inventory. </p><p><b> Balancing Choices </b></p><p> There are two fundamental choices for landowners to make among many possible woodland-management options and values. </p><ol> <li>The first choice is to determine a basic level of environmentally sustainable care for your woodland that will ensure ongoing protection of the entire woodland ecosystem. All woodland management, no matter what your personal objectives, should meet basic environmental goals.</li> <li>The second choice is the balance of emphasis you wish to place among different values or uses reflecting your own personal interests, from conserving biodiversity and watching wildlife, to harvesting timber and firewood.</li> </ol> In this book, we will deal with both of these aspects of managing your woodlot. <p></p><p> In the first case, there are basic steps you should take to ensure the minimum level of environmental sustainability for your woodland. These include protection of the drainage pattern, protection of nesting birds from disturbance, and if harvesting timber, strict adherence to sustainable forest practices, among other concerns. </p><p> These basic requirements for sustainable woodlot management are emphasized throughout the book. They will be reflected in different chapters and depend on your own management interests. Remember, the best environmental management of your woodland is usually the</p></p><h2>Supervision: Concepts and Skill-Building</h2><p>Certo's Supervision: Concepts and Skill-Building 10e, prepares students to be supervisors in a challenging modern workplace. &nbsp;It is based on the premise that organizational variables including diversity in the workplace, computer and communication technology, and the design of organizational structures are constantly changing. &nbsp;Overall, this text focuses on discussing important supervision concepts and providing fundamental skills necessary for applying these concepts.

In 2014, the notebooks from 1931 to 1941 were published, sparking immediate controversy. It has long been acknowledged that Heidegger was an enthusiastic supporter of the Nazi Party in the early 1930s. But the notebooks contain a number of anti-Semitic passages&#x2015;often referring to the stereotype of &#x201c;World-Jewry&#x201d;&#x2015;written even after Heidegger became disenchanted with the Nazis themselves. Reactions from the scholarly community have ranged from dismissal of the significance of these passages to claims that the anti-Semitism in them contaminates all of Heidegger's work. This volume offers the first collection of responses by Heidegger scholars to the publication of the notebooks. In essays commissioned especially for the book, the contributors offer a wide range of views, addressing not only the issues of anti-Semitism and Nazism but also the broader questions that the notebooks raise.</p><p><b>Contributors<br></b>Babette Babich, Andrew Bowie, Steven Crowell, Fred Dallmayr, Donatella Di Cesare, Michael Fagenblat, Ingo Farin, Gregory Fried, Jean Grondin, Karsten Harries, Laurence Paul Hemming, Jeff Malpas, Thomas Rohkr�mer, Tracy B.

What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published <i>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</i>. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.</p><br><p> This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the <i>New York Times</i>, tthe <i>American Economic Review</i>, and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.</p></p><p><b>John von Neumann</b> (1903-1957) was one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century and a pioneering figure in computer science. A native of Hungary who held professorships in Germany, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in 1933. Later he worked on the Manhattan Project, helped develop the IAS computer, and was a consultant to IBM. An important influence on many fields of mathematics, he is the author of <i>Functional Operators, Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics</i>, and <i>Continuous Geometry</i> (all Princeton). <b>Oskar Morgenstern</b> (1902-1977) taught at the University of Vienna and directed the Austrian Institute of Business Cycle Research before settling in the United States in 1938. There he joined the faculty of Princeton University, eventually becoming a professor and from 1948 directing its econometric research program. He advised the United States government on a wide variety of subjects. Though most famous for the book he co-authored with von Neumann, Morgenstern was also widely known for his skepticism about economic measurement, as reflected in one of his many other books, <i>On the Accuracy of Economic Observations</i> (Princeton). <b>Harold Kuhn</b> is Professor Emeritus of Mathematical Economics at Princeton University. <b>Ariel Rubinstein</b> is Professor of Economics at Tel Aviv University and at New York University."One cannot but admire the audacity of vision, the perseverance in details, and the depth of thought displayed in almost every page of the book. . . . The appearance of a book of [this] calibre . . . is indeed a rare event." (<i>The American Economic Review</i>)<br><br>"Posterity may regard this book as one of the major scientific achievements of the first half of the twentieth century. This will undoubtedly be the case if the authors have succeeded in establishing a new exact science--the science of economics. The foundation which they have laid is extremely promising." (<i>The Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society</i>)<br><br>"Praise for Princeton's previous edition: "Opinions still vary on the success of the project to put economics on a sound mathematical footing, but game theory was eventually hugely influential, especially on mathematics and the study of automata. Every self-respecting library must have one.""<b>---Mike Holderness, <i>New Scientist</i></b><br><br>"While the jury is still out on the success or failure of game theory as an attempted palace coup within the economics community, few would deny that interest in the subject--as measured in numbers of journal page--is at or near an all-time high. For that reason alone, this handsome new edition of von Neumann and Morgenstern's still controversial classic should be welcomed by the entire research community."<b>---James Case, <i>SIAM News</i></b><br><br>"The main achievement of the book lies, more than in its concrete results, in its having introduced into economics the tools of modern logic and in using them with an astounding power of generalization." (<i>The Journal of Political Economy</i>)<br><br>"Praise for Princeton's previous edition: "A rich and multifaceted work. . . . [S]ixty years later, the <i>Theory of Games</i> may indeed be viewed as one of the landmarks of twentieth-century social science.""<b>---Robert J.

As poverty and unrest took root in eighteenth-century Kentucky, western lawmakers championed ideas about whiteness, manhood, and patriarchal authority to help stabilize a politically fractious frontier. Honor Sachs combines rigorous scholarship with an engaging narrative to examine how conditions in Kentucky facilitated the expansion of rights for white men in ways that would become a model for citizenship in the country as a whole. Endorsed by many prominent western historians, this groundbreaking work is a major contribution to frontier scholarship.</p><p><b>Honor Sachs </b>is assistant professor of history at University of Colorado Boulder.&#x201c;Honor Sachs demonstrates conclusively that understanding the early American frontier requires taking women and their families seriously.

He fell on the floor in a heap, unable to stand or control his limbs, having lost the sense of joint position and proprioception, of that "sixth sense" of his body in space, which we all take for granted. After months in a neurological ward he was judged incurable and condemned to a life of wheelchair dependence. This is the first U.S. publication of a remarkable book by his physician, Jonathan Cole. It tells the compelling story, including a clear clinical description of a rare condition, of how Waterman reclaimed a life of full mobility against all expectations, by mental effort and sheer courage. Cole describes how Waterman gradually adapted to his strange condition. As the doctors had predicted, there was no neurological recovery. He had to monitor every movement by sight to work out where his limbs were, since he had no feedback from his peripheral nerves. But with astonishing persistence Waterman developed elaborate tricks and strategies to control his movements, enabling him to cope not only with the day-to-day problems of living, but even with the challenges of work, love, and marriage.</p></p><p>Jonathan Cole, D.M., F.R.C.P., is Consultant in Clinical Neurophysiology, Poole Hospital, and at Salisbury Hospital (with its Spinal Centre), a Professor at Bournemouth University and a visiting Senior Lecturer, Southampton University.<br><br>The late Oliver Sacks was a neurologist and the author of <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</i>, <i>Awakenings</i>, <i>Musicophilia</i>, and other books.<p>A story at once terrifying and inspiring....It is a remarkable human document, a neurological epic.

Tying our past experiences to our present interactions with the environment, they enable us to recognize and understand new objects and events. Concepts are also relevant to understanding domains such as social situations, personality types, and even artistic styles. Yet like other phenomenologically simple cognitive processes such as walking or understanding speech, concept formation and use are maddeningly complex.</p><p>Research since the 1970s and the decline of the "classical view" of concepts have greatly illuminated the psychology of concepts. But persistent theoretical disputes have sometimes obscured this progress. <i>The Big Book of Concepts</i> goes beyond those disputes to reveal the advances that have been made, focusing on the major empirical discoveries. By reviewing and evaluating research on diverse topics such as category learning, word meaning, conceptual development in infants and children, and the basic level of categorization, the book develops a much broader range of criteria than is usual for evaluating theories of concepts.</p></p><p>"Murphy's well-written Big Book of Concepts provides a much-needed overview of the rapidly developing field of concept learning and use.

Holzapfel Graz University of Technology, Austria With a modern, comprehensive approach directed towards computational mechanics, this book covers a unique combination of subjects at present unavailable in any other text. It includes vital information on 'variational principles' constituting the cornerstone of the finite element method. In fact this is the only method by which Nonlinear Solid Mechanics is utilized in engineering practice. The book opens with a fundamental chapter on vectors and tensors. The following chapters are based on nonlinear continuum mechanics - an inevitable prerequisite for computational mechanicians. In addition, continuum field theory (applied to a representative sample of hyperelastic materials currently used in nonlinear computations such as incompressible and compressible materials) is presented, as are transversely isotropic materials, composite materials, viscoelastic materials and hyperelastic materials with isotropic damage. Another central chapter is devoted to the thermodynamics of materials, covering both finite thermoelasticity and finite thermoviscoelasticity. Also included are:<br> * an up-to-date list of almost 300 references and a comprehensive index<br> * useful examples and exercises for the student<br> * selected topics of statistical and continuum thermodynamics.<br> Furthermore, the principle of virtual work (in both the material and spatial descriptions) is compared with two and three-field variational principles particularly designed to capture kinematic constraints such as incompressibility. All of the features combined result in an essential text for final year undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers in mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering and applied maths and physics.</p><p><p>Gerhard A.

An elegant symbol of turn-of-the-century classicism, the station was designed by the preeminent architects of the period, McKim, Mead &amp; White, and completed in 1910. Accompanied by 80 vintage photographs, Lorraine Diehl lovingly documents the labor involved in the creation of this great building and traces the mid-20th-century development interests and capitalist forces that destroyed it in 1963. While there was no public outcry to save the building, once New Yorkers realized the extent of their loss, it helped pave the way for a nationwide preservation movement. This book convincingly reasserts the profound importance of our public urban architecture--culturally, socially, and aesthetically--to our collective memory and history.Although demolished more than 20 years ago, New York's monumental Pennsylvania Station continues to hold a strong fascination for social and architectural historians alike. The demolition of the station became the turning point for the historic preservation movement in this country. The gateway to New York City for over 50 years was the masterpiece of McKim Mead and White, America's preeminent firm in the first decades of the 20th century. Diehl has crafted an engrossing, superbly researched account that recaptures the drama and grandeur of the station from its planning and construction, through its golden years in the 1920s, to its decline and senseless destruction in 1964. Handsomely illustrated with numerous photographs and drawings, this book is highly recommended for most libraries. H.

In this book Robin Milner introduces a new way of modelling communication that reflects its position. He treats computers and their programs as themselves built from communicating parts, rather than adding communication as an extra level of activity. Everything is introduced by means of examples, such as mobile phones, job schedualers, vending machines, data structures, and the objects of object-oriented programming. But the aim of the book is to develop a theory, the pi-calculus, in which these things can be treated rigorously. The pi-calculus differs from other models of communicating behaviour mainly in its treatment of mobility. The movement of a piece of data inside a computer program is treated exactly the same as the transfer of a message--or indeed an entire computer program--across the internet. One can also describe networks which reconfigure themselves. The calculus is very simple but powerful; its most prominent ingredient is the notion of a name. Its theory has two important ingredients: the concept of behavioural (or observational) equivalence, and the use of a new theory of types to classify patterns of interactive behaviour. The internet, and its communication protocols, fall within the scope of the theory just as much as computer programs, data structures, algorithms and programming languages. This book is the first textbook on the subject; it has been long-awaited by professionals and will be welcome by them, and their students.</p><p>Robin Milner introduces a new way of modelling communication that reflects its central position in computing.

John House examines the style and technique, subject matter and imagery, exhibiting and marketing strategies, and social, political, and ideological contexts of Impressionism in light of the perspectives that have been brought to it in the last twenty years. When all of these diverse approaches are taken into account, he argues, Impressionism can be seen as a movement that challenged both artistic and political authority with its uncompromisingly modern subject matter and its determinedly secular worldview.<br><br> Moving from the late 1860s to the early 1880s, House analyzes the paintings and career strategies of the leading Impressionist artists, pointing out the ways in which they countered the dominant conventions of the contemporary art world and evolved their distinctive and immediately recognizable manner of painting. Focusing closely on the technique, composition, and imagery of the paintings themselves and combining this fresh appraisal with recent historical studies of Impressionism, House explores how pictorial style could generate social and political meanings and opens new ways of looking at this luminous art.</p></p><p><p><b>John House</b> is the Walter H. Annenberg Professor at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London. He is the author of, among other works, <i>Monet: Nature into Art, </i>published by Yale University Press.</p>While every Art History 101 student knows that Impressionism challenged the prevailing aesthetic of its day, Professor House seeks to show that this challenge was also at least obliquely political: Impressionist paintings, he argues, undermined a clearly understood social hierarchy through their fixation on the fleeting, mysterious sensations of modern life. House presents this idea with too many caveats and qualifications for it to carry much force, and, more critically, he provides virtually no historical context for his claim. Without elaboration, he calls the climate of 1870s France "repressive," yet he also details how the Impressionists, with apparent impunity, mounted their first group shows at this time. House&#x2014;who looks a bit like Sting and teaches at London&#x2019;s renowned Courtauld Institute of Art&#x2014;too often seems to conflate the aesthetic authority of the Salon (the annual exhibit of the French cultural establishment) with the political authority of the French government. But what makes this book rewarding despite its attenuated conclusions is House&#x2019;s commentary on the paintings themselves, which are generously reproduced here. Taking to task colleagues who focus solely on a single aspect of art history&#x2014;gender, authority, technique, etc.&#x2014;House analyzes the paintings from many angles, illuminating everything from the quality of individual brush strokes to the choice of subject matter. In the process, House rescues the Impressionists from both the modernist narrative that grants them only a bit part in the development of 20th-century "pure painting," and the purveyors of museum gift shop calendars who see no more than a superficial prettiness. Though they may not be bomb-tossing dissidents, the Impressionists, as presented by House, are prickly, complex individuals richly deserving of this fresh look.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The papers, many of them previously inaccessible to non-specialist readers, explore such fundamental issues as the relationship between style and content in the exploration of ethical issues; the nature of ethical attention and ethical knowledge and their relationship to written forms and styles; and the role of the emotions in deliberation and self-knowledge. Nussbaum investigates and defends a conception of ethical understanding which involves emotional as well as intellectual activity, and which gives a certain type of priority to the perception of particular people and situations rather than to abstract rules. She argues that this ethical conception cannot be completely and appropriately stated without turning to forms of writing usually considered literary rather than philosophical. It is consequently necessary to broaden our conception of moral philosophy in order to include these forms. Featuring two new essays and revised versions of several previously published essays, this collection attempts to articulate the relationship, within such a broader ethical inquiry, between literary and more abstractly theoretical elements.</p><p>This volume collects my published papers on the relationship between literature and philosophy, especially moral philosophy.<br><strong>Martha C.

In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, renowned evolutionary scholar Bernard Wood traces the history of paleoanthropology from its beginnings in the eighteenth century to today's latest fossil finds. Along the way we are introduced to the lively cast of characters, past and present, involved in evolutionary research. Although concentrating on the fossil evidence for human evolution, the book also covers the latest genetic evidence about regional variations in the modern human genome that relate to our evolutionary history. Wood draws on over thirty years of experience to provide an insiders view of the field, and demonstrates that our understanding of human evolution is critically dependent on advances in related sciences such as paleoclimatology, geochronology, systematics, genetics, and developmental biology. This is an ideal introduction for anyone interested in the origins and development of humankind.<br></p><p><br><strong>Bernard Wood</strong> is Henry R.

At the centre of the story are a young struggling author, an orphaned teenager and a depraved aristocrat, who not only foreshadows the great figures of evil in Dostoevsky's later fiction, but is a powerful and original presence in his own right.</p><p>This new translation catches the verve and tumult of the original, which &#x2013; in concept and execution &#x2013; affords a refreshingly unfamiliar glimpse of the author.</p></p><p>Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821&#x2013;81) is considered one of the greatest writers of all time.

They are composed purely and wholly of the stuff of the soul. Against our wills we are drawn in, whirled round, blinded, suffocated, and at the same time filled with a giddy rapture.

Based on a wealth of primary material, ranging from interviews to FBI reports, this book reconstructs the motivation and ideology of violent organizations active during the 1960s and 1970s. Varon conveys the intense passions of the era--the heat of moral purpose, the depth of Utopian longing, the sense of danger and despair, and the exhilaration over temporary triumphs. Varon's compelling interpretation of the logic and limits of dissent in democratic societies provides striking insights into the role of militancy in contemporary protest movements and has wide implications for the United States' current "war on terrorism."<br><br>Varon explores Weatherman and RAF's strong similarities and the reasons why radicals in different settings developed a shared set of values, languages, and strategies. Addressing the relationship of historical memory to political action, Varon demonstrates how Germany's fascist past influenced the brutal and escalating nature of the West German conflict in the 60s and 70s, as well as the reasons why left-wing violence dropped sharply in the United States during the 1970s. <i>Bringing the War Home</i> is a fascinating account of why violence develops within social movements, how states can respond to radical dissent and forms of terror, how the rational and irrational can combine in political movements, and finally how moral outrage and militancy can play both constructive and destructive roles in efforts at social change.</p><p>"Jeremy Varon in <i>Bringing the War Home </i>achieves something very difficult, and very important: he conveys the intense heat of moral purpose and political conviction that drove some radicals to violence, while at the same time he maintains a cool analytic distance that enables him to provide a brilliant and compelling interpretation of the logic and limits of dissent in democratic societies. And his conclusions illuminate pressing issues about the role of militancy in contemporary protest movements."&#x2015;Jon Wiener, author of <i>Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files</i><br><br>"By looking seriously at the rise of revolutionary violence and the international dimensions of that phenomenon, Jeremy Varon makes an invaluable contribution to our understanding of 'The Sixties.' His book paints a nuanced picture of a period in recent history that in many ways remains an open wound. In so doing, Varon helps us to see the world today more clearly. This is extremely important history-especially for young people."&#x2015;Sam Green, Director/Producer of "The Weather Underground"<br><br>"Jeremy Varon's important and courageous book marks a turning point in the scholarship about the 1960s and their aftermath. With an admirable mixture of distance and engagement, Varon brings to bear the classic questions which European and American historians have applied to questions of politics and violence. <i>Bringing the War Home</i> makes significant contributions to understanding terrible events.

Red Handed</p><h2>The Merriam-Webster Dictionary</h2><p>Defines more than sixty thousand words and phrases and includes biographical and geographical names, foreign phrases, and advice on grammar</p><p><p> The Merriam brothers desired a continuity of editorship that would link Noah Webster's efforts with their own editions, so they selected Chauncey A. Goodrich, Webster's son-in-law and literary heir, who had been trained in lexicography by Webster himself, to be their editor in chief. Webster's son William also served as an editor of that first Merriam-Webster dictionary, which was published on September 24, 1847. </p> <p> Although Webster's work was honored, his big dictionaries had never sold well. The 1828 edition was priced at a whopping $20; in 13 years its 2,500 copies had not sold out. Similarly, the 1841 edition, only slightly more affordable at $15, moved slowly. Assuming that a lower price would increase sales, the Merriams introduced the 1847 edition at $6, and although Webster's heirs initially questioned this move, extraordinary sales that brought them $250,000 in royalties over the ensuing 25 years convinced them that the Merriams' decision had been abundantly sound. </p> <p> The first Merriam-Webster dictionary was greeted with wide acclaim. President James K. Polk, General Zachary Taylor (hero of the Mexican War and later president himself), 31 U.S. senators, and other prominent people hailed it unreservedly. In 1850 its acceptance as a resource for students began when Massachusetts ordered a copy for every school and New York placed a similar order for 10,000 copies to be used in schools throughout the state. Eventually school use would spread throughout the country. In becoming America's most trusted authority on the English language, Merriam-Webster dictionaries had taken on a role of public responsibility demanded of few other publishing companies.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Rising to Power: The Journey of Exceptional Executives</h2><p><b>AMAZON BEST SELLER IN MENTORING &amp; COACHING</b><br><br> <b><i>Rising to Power</i> is a time tested, wisdom-packed guide for executives desiring to be exceptional leaders as they navigate their ascent to the highest levels of their organization. </b> Nearly two-thirds of all leaders entering executive roles lack sufficient understanding of what is required and are unprepared for what they will face, which explains why 50 percent of them fail within the first eighteen months. <br><br>For decades we have known that failure rates among transitioning executives are too high, causing exorbitant costs, damaged organizations, and stalled careers. Still, little has changed in the way organizations prepare leaders to assume executive positions. Three-fourths of new executives say their organization did not adequately prepare them for the executive office. It doesn't have to be this way. <br><br>If you are an executive--or you're aspiring to be one--and considering how you will navigate the ascent in your organization, <i>Rising to Power</i> will serve you like no other resource can. Odds are high you have watched a promising executive fail on their way up. Like many, you scratched your head, wondering, ''Why didn't they see that coming?'' Now you're hoping not to be the next one that falls. <i>Rising to Power</i> will guide you on a predictable journey of ascent, through the transitional moments and issues most common in executive failure. It will bolster your confidence, open your eyes, deepen your insight, and if you let it, reveal your own proclivities for failure that you may not even recognize.

The result is an up-to-date, indispensable guide to becoming a senior leader and succeeding at the top. [...] Carucci and Hansen pull no punches in this smart set of instructions for new bosses. getAbstract recommends their findings as essential reading for executives moving up.<br>-<strong> Rated 9/10 by getAbstract <br></strong><br>Executives stumble in new jobs at least half the time. How do you avoid the failure trap? That&#x2019;s the question Carucci and Hansen answer.<br>&nbsp;-- <strong>FORTUNE</strong> <br><br>Boasting a prestigious list of clients including Fortune 50 companies as well as authorship of some seven books, former organization development professor (Fordham Univ.) and seasoned consultant Carucci joins with experienced executive and fellow consultant Hansen in producing a guide for rising executives. Their stated purpose is to diminish the ''growing disconnect between readiness and expectation among new executives'' and to identify for organizations ''mechanisms required to multiply and unleash executive capacity.'' Skills and traits for successful transition that have been distilled into categories termed Breadth, Choice, Context, and Connection were derived from text analysis of survey responses from over 100 executives, with increasing company stock price as the criterion for executive success. Well-worn advice about demolishing silos, cultivating 360-�degree information networks, building mutual trust, setting priorities, strategic decision making, openness to innovation, problem solving, and developing extensive knowledge about one's company and industry is mingled with admonishments to use one's power for good and to create an organization that fosters joy and loves fully engaged employees back. The takeaway is that since ascent to power can't be separated from personal sacrifice, occasional setbacks, and relinquishment of many characteristics and behaviors heretofore associated with success, a upcoming executive should hold fast to the vision of lasting success that can be achieved under his or her leadership. --<strong>-Library Journal Review<br></strong><br>&#x201c;In Rising to Power, Carucci and Hansen offer aspiring executives great advice as they face the challenges of transitioning into executive roles. They help executives shift from being overwhelmed and potentially paralyzed to mastering the executive altitude of organizations.

It incorporates knowledge from many disciplines and integrates best practices from classrooms to inform readers of how to work with children who grow up gifted and bring their gifts to the world. The author encourages readers to understand intelligence in order to help more children realize their unique potential of gifts and talents. The new edition will also feature more information for general education teachers on how to work with gifted and talented students in inclusive environments by offering more strategies and activities that educators can utilize in the classroom as well as in home-based settings. Throughout, the author incorporates knowledge from many disciplines, a wide range of research, best practices available for nurturing giftedness in the classro</p><p>One of the leading books in the field, this edition offers the most interesting, information-packed introduction available to the characteristics of the gifted and talented children.<p> This is the sixth edition of <i>Growing Up Gifted.</i> As I began the first edition more than 20 years ago, it was my intention to write a book for my students that would include the ideas I found important in supporting my work with gifted learners. I wanted the book to be helpful to the parents of gifted students as well because I believe that parents are their first and most important teachers. Brain researchers had just begun to talk about the implications of their work for human learning, and I wanted to make that information available to those with whom I worked. The importance of early learning in human mental development was just being noted and, in some scientific circles, enriching our heredity was first being discussed. I wanted to bring these ideas into the classrooms so that all children could come closer to reaching their full potential. </p> <p> As my students and I worked to bring research into practice for seven years in an experimental school setting we developed with gifted and highly gifted learners, we shared excitement and growth. Later editions of the book reflected that growth, explored new ideas, and began to be useful not only to my students but to students throughout the world. Over the years, the work of many other researchers enriched our efforts. </p> <p> At this writing, the book retains parts of its original structure and yet has included knowledge and practice froth so many others that it is only the vision that remains the same. Optimizing learning, synthesizing knowledge from many disciplines, and bringing together and integrating best practices from classrooms where children grow all added to the texture of the book. All of this is communicated to advocate for students whom the schools have designated as gifted learners. By sharing it, I hope that more children will grow up gifted and bring their gifts to the world. </p> <p> There are three parts to the book: Part I is intended to create an understanding of who gifted learners are, how they become gifted, and what giftedness and creativity are like as one grows cognitively, socially, emotionally, and intuitively. </p> <p> Part II builds on this understanding by describing school programs. How gifted learners can be supported at school and the services required to meet their needs and optimize their experiences are explored. A continuum of such services is discussed, and the options that schools can develop to serve gifted learners in the elementary, middle school, and high school programs are described. Homeschooling and global education are a part of this discussion. Evaluating programs to improve their quality, reach, and impact is explored. The methods and complexities of identifying giftedness are also found in this section. </p> <p> Part III is devoted to the theories and practices of teaching gifted learners. Numerous curriculum models used to provide education for gifted learners are described. The ideas for optimizing learning that have been evolving from the 1970s are organized and shared and the integrative Education Model, developed from translating brain research for use in the classroom, is briefly explained. Differentiating and individualizing the curriculum and the instruction, so necessary for gifted learners, are a part of the knowledge base shared in this section. </p> <p> Finally, the diversity of cultures and the effect they have on the development and the expression of giftedness is explored. The impact of gender, race, ethnicity, and poverty must be carefully considered and possible avenues of intervention understood if we are to overcome any barriers that students from these cultural groups might encounter. Gifted learners who are in need because of disabilities or underachievement and those learners who are limited by their experiences with cultural diversity must be helped to reverse the loss and realize the strength and richness that such diversity can bring. Only through extending our knowledge base and increasing the number of strategies that work grill we be able to meet these needs. </p> <p> This book is written for the teachers at home and at school who are striving to understand a little better, reach a little higher, and achieve with excellence a little more often. At this time there is more research in the field, more programs available in the school, more theories and practices to report, and more attention to quality evident. I have tried to bring a well-rounded sample of all this growth to you so that you can use it for the students whom you have chosen to serve. Included are activities, summaries, questions, graphics, charts, illustrations, and vignettes drawn from my experiences to aid in your understanding. </p> <p> The book ends with a special epilogue that shares an experience that profoundly affected me during a trip to the newly reestablished nation Kyrgyzstan. With the sharing of this experience, we come full circle to the concerns of excellence and equity explored in the first chapter. I believe that all of you who have chosen to support the growth of gifted learners will find in this book much that will aid you to be more effective and caring in your work. The information in this book provides, however, more than educational ideas; it provides a way, as my colleague in Kyrgyzstan so eloquently stated, "to survive as a country and find our leaders in our children." It is my intent to provide you with an understanding of intelligence and its nurture so that more of our children can realize their unique gifts and talents and by your efforts they may truly have the opportunity to be <i>growing up gifted.</i> </p> <p><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></p> <p> I would like to thank the reviewers of this edition: Dorothy Armstrong, Grand Valley State University; Art Attell, University of Arkansas at Monticello; and Leonard Ganschow, Miami University, Ohio.

Everywhere we turn, someone is preaching the &#x201c;One True Way&#x201d; to eat for maximum health. Paleo Diet advocates tell us that all foods less than 12,000 years old are the enemy. Low-carb gurus demonize carbs, then there are the low-fat prophets. But they agree on one thing: there is only one true way to eat for maximum health. The first clue that that is a fallacy is the sheer variety of diets advocated. Indeed, while all of these competing views claim to be backed by &#x201c;science,&#x201d; a good look at actual nutritional science itself suggests that it is impossible to identify a single best way to eat. Fitzgerald advocates an agnostic, rational approach to eating habits, based on one&#x2019;s own habits, lifestyle, and genetics/body type. Many professional athletes already practice this &#x201c;Good Enough&#x201d; diet, and now we can too and ditch the brainwashing of these diet cults for good.</p><p>Matt Fitzgerald&nbsp;is an acclaimed endurance sports and nutrition writer and a certified sports nutritionist. He is the bestselling author of more than a dozen books on running and fitness, including&nbsp;80/20 Running, How Bad Do You Want It, Racing Weight, and&nbsp;Iron War, which was long-listed for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year and Diet Cults, also available from Pegasus Books.

"<br><br>In this book, Fitzgerald takes aim at the long list of dietary approaches that claim to be the "One True Way" to eat healthily, arguing instead for what he calls "agnostic healthy eating." The key (which he has introduced in previous books) is a ranking of 10 categories of food, and the goal is simply that, wherever a food falls in that hierarchy, you should generally aim to have more of the foods that rank above it and less of the foods that rank below it. And you know what? I agree. You can quibble about some of the details, but this is not a bad description of the way I aim to eat. I'll eat anything, more or less, but always aiming to have more of the things at the top of the ladder than at the bottom.

But two hundred years before the rise of literary realism, Dutch painters had already made an art of the everyday--pictures that served as a compelling model for the novelists who followed. By the mid-1800s, seventeenth-century Dutch painting figured virtually everywhere in the British and French fiction we esteem today as the vanguard of realism. Why were such writers drawn to this art of two centuries before? What does this tell us about the nature of realism?</p><p> In this beautifully illustrated and elegantly written book, Ruth Yeazell explores the nineteenth century's fascination with Dutch painting, as well as its doubts about an art that had long challenged traditional values.</p><p> After showing how persistent tensions between high theory and low genre shaped criticism of novels and pictures alike, <i>Art of the Everyday</i> turns to four major novelists--Honor� de Balzac, George Eliot, Thomas Hardy, and Marcel Proust--who strongly identified their work with Dutch painting. For all these writers, Dutch art provided a model for training themselves to look closely at the particulars of middle-class life.</p><p> Yet even as nineteenth-century novelists strove to create illusions of the real by modeling their narratives on Dutch pictures, Yeazell argues, they chafed at the model. A concluding chapter on Proust explains why the nineteenth century associated such realism with the past and shows how the rediscovery of Vermeer helped resolve the longstanding conflict between humble details and the aspirations of high art.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Art of the Everyday</i> is a work of extraordinary scholarship that significantly expands our understanding both of realism and of Dutch painting. All the big subjects related to realism are here, all handled with utmost care. One of the most satisfying things about this learned, insightful book is that it gives the impression of absolute saturation in the art and in the fictions, and thus it earns its authority in both fields."<b>--George Levine, author of <i>The Realistic Imagination</i></b></p><p>"I tremendously enjoyed reading <i>Art of the Everyday</i>. One of the great pleasures it offers is the revisiting of something commonly assumed to be self-evident--the comparison between realist fiction and Dutch art. Ruth Yeazell makes us realize just how blind we've been to the range of implications this comparison carries with it. Lucid, knowledgeable, and extremely readable, this exciting book deepens our understanding of all that's at stake in the cultural politics of realism."<b>--Kate Flint, author of <i>The Victorians and the Visual Imagination</i></b></p><p>"Extremely thorough and precise but written with elegance and fluidity, <i>Art of the Everyday</i> is an excellent and entertaining book that impressively integrates the art-historical and the literary."<b>--Martha Hollander, author of <i>An Entrance for the Eyes: Space and Meaning in Seventeenth-Century Dutch Art</i></b></p><b>Ruth Bernard Yeazell</b> is the Chace Family Professor of English and director of the Lewis Walpole Library at Yale University. Her books include <i>Harems of the Mind: Passages of Western Art and Literature</i>.</p><h2>The Necklace and Other Short Stories</h2><p>The French author Guy de Maupassant (1850-1893) was a master of the short story, creating detailed character studies and brief but moving dramas well suited to the genre.<br>The nine stories in this collection provide a vivid portrait gallery of his typical subjects &#x2014; from simple peasants and prostitutes to soldiers, government clerks, and provincial bourgeois. Brilliantly naturalistic, these short works also reveal Maupassant's ability to observe the innumerable details of everyday life and reproduce them artfully and accurately, often with a caustic sense of humor.<br>His literary talents are amply displayed in this volume, which includes these memorable tales: "Ball-of-Fat," regarded by many as technically one of the finest short stories ever written, "The Necklace," "A Piece of String," "Mme. Tellier's Establishment," "Mademoiselle Fifi," "Miss Harriet," "A Way to Wealth," "My Uncle Jules," and "The Horla."</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Women in Late Antiquity: Pagan and Christian Lifestyles</h2><p>This book bridges a gap between two traditional disciplines. Since the 1970s, there has been a remarkable outpouring of work on women in antiquity, but women in late antiquity (3rd-6th centuries A.D.) have been far less studied. Classicists have been more concerned with the first two centuries A.D., and theologians have been interested in New Testament, rather than patristic, teaching about women or its social and cultural setting. In this book, Clark offers an introduction to the basic conditions of life for women: marriage, divorce, celibacy and prostitution; legal constraints and protection; child-bearing, health care, and medical theories; housing, housework, and clothes; and the general assumptions about female nature which were discarded at need. Christian and non-Christian literature, art, and archaeology are used to exemplify both the practicalities of life and the prevailing &#34;discourses&#34; of the ancient world.</p><p>Gillian Clark is a Lecturer in the School of Archaeology, Classics and Oriental Studies at the University of Liverpool.<br>"Clearly and engagingly written and will be of use in undergraduate courses on women in antiquity."--<em>Religious Studies Review</em><p></p><br>"An excellent and lucid study of women and their rights (or lack thereof) at the crucial period, the transition from paganism to Christianity, and the resulting laws.

Mathematical Programming Society Newsletter Model Building in Mathematical Programming Fourth Edition H. Paul Williams Faculty of Mathematical Studies, University of Southampton, UK<br> <br> This extensively revised fourth edition of this well-known and much praised book contains a great deal of new material. In particular sections and new problems have been added covering Revenue Management. Hydro Electric Generation, Date Envelopment (efficiency) Analysis, Milk Distribution and Collection and Constraint Programming. The book discusses the general principles of model building in mathematical programming and shows how they can be applied by using simplified but practical problems from widely different contexts. Suggested formulations and solutions are given in the latter part of the book together with computational experience to give the reader a feel for the computation difficulty of solving that particular type of model. Aimed at undergraduates, postgraduates, research students and managers, this book illustrates the scope and limitations of mathematical programming, and shows how it can be applied to real situations. By emphasizing the importance of the building and interpretation of models rather than the solution process, the author attempts to fill a gap left by the many works which concentrate on the algorithmic side of the subject.</p><p></p><h2>A Guinea Pig Pride &amp; Prejudice (Guinea Pig Classics)</h2><p><p><i>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single guinea pig in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>It is a truth personally acknowledged by Mrs. Bennet that all five of her furry daughters--Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia--are in need of husbands. </p><p>To her mother's grave disappointment, Elizabeth Bennet is headstrong and won't take just anyone, especially not the haughty Mr. Darcy.* Elizabeth blames the arrogant gentleman for steering Mr. Bingley, one of the rare men in possession of a good fortune, away from her older sister Jane.

Together with a group of friends from different countries you will live in Krakow the most popular city in Poland, a seat of learning, a city of magnificent monuments, rich cultural life and unforgettable atmosphere. You will quickly discover that this is the place for studying Polish and an ideal location for exceptional holidays. Together you will not only learn the language, but also go shopping, eat in restaurants, cook, visit interesting places and discover Polish culture. Living with a Polish family, you will have the chance to experience Polish hospitality and become familiar with Polish customs. Experienced and enthusiastic teachers, who treat their work as a genuine passion, will show you the ins and outs of the Polish language. Polski, krok po kroku is written only in Polish, as this method of presenting a new language brings the best results. It leads students into the language system in a natural way and from the very start encourages you to speak in Polish. As this handbook constitutes a part of a larger interactive course in Polish, available at e-polish.eu , it can equally be used for studying on your own. The website includes comments in different languages and a multimedia dictionary, which allows you to learn without the help of teachers. Next to each exercise in the handbook there is a number which helps you to find the exercise in the Internet course and check the answers, listen to the recordings or do alternative exercises that will help in consolidating the material or explaining any doubts you may have.

McCaughrean's fine retelling of Odysseus' wanderings is a heroic tale in the truest sense of the word. It captures all the drama and bloodcurdling action of the original work while making the story accessible to young people in language that is still vigorous and expressive. Odysseus is a commanding figure, a bold leader, able to outwit the strongest monsters, yet so weak he cowers in Calypso's chamber. Readers can follow Odysseus' encounters with Circe, the Lotus-eaters, Poseidon, and Calypso, among others, as well as Penelope's difficulties with her suitors back home. Illustrations by Victor Ambrus complement McCaughrean's style perfectly, their bold colors and lively portrayals displaying all the energy of the text. Ambrus' renderings of the monsters are particularly gruesome. A worthy addition to most library collections. <i>Chris Sherman</i></p><h2>Typographic Specimens: The Great Typefaces</h2><p>Specimens of 38 of the finest type families in the world are brought together in <i>Typographic Specimens: The Great Typefaces</i>, making it an invaluable reference tool for graphic designers, editors, art directors, production managers, desktop publishers, and students. Each type family is shown in display and text specimens with complete fonts including italic and bold variations; extended families such as Futura and Univers include additional type weights and widths. Each type family's section opens with a full-page experimental design, created by an outstanding graphic designer to demonstrate its potential. The specimens are accompanied by a concise discussion of each type family's origins, charactertistics, and usage. Typographic specimens provide an opportunity to study typefaces, to select and plan typography, and to increase one's knowledge of letterforms. Drawing and tracing specimens remain excellent ways to understand type and create logos and other typographic designs. Study of specimens aids in the selection of fonts to be purchased for the font library. Typographic specimens introduce unfamiliar typefaces in printed form and aid in the development of connoisseurship. Comparative analysis of similar faces in printed form becomes possible. Over one hundred prominent designers and design educators were sent a ballot listing all major typefaces and were asked to vote for the type families that best fulfilled their personal criteria for typographic excellence. The typefaces contained in this book represent the results of this poll, providing a compendium of excellent typefaces that have stood the test of time. <p><i>Typographic Specimens: The Great Typefaces</i> will provide information, inspiration, and a keener knowledge of typography.</p> Akzidenz-Grotesk<br>American Typewriter<br>Baskerville<br>Bembo<br>Bodoni<br>Bookman<br>Caledonia<br>Caslon<br>Centaur<br>Century Schoolbook<br>Cheltenham<br>Clarendon<br>Didot<br>Folio<br>Franklin Gothic<br>Frutiger<br>Futura<br>Galliard<br>Gill Sans<br>Garamond<br>Goudy Old Style<br>Helvetica<br>Janson<br>Kabel<br>News Gothic<br>Optima<br>Palatino<br>Perpetua<br>Plantin<br>Sabon<br>Serifa<br>Stone Sans<br>Stone Serif<br>Stymie<br>Times New Roman<br>Trump Mediaeval<br>Univers<br>Zapf Book</p><p><b>Philip Meggs</b> is professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, contributing editor of Print magazine, and visiting graduate faculty at Syracuse University.

Yet from such basics, he became one of the most prolific and wide-ranging experimental scientists who ever lived. As a bookbinder's apprentice with a voracious appetite for learning, he read every book he got his hands on. In 1812 he attended a series of chemistry lectures by Sir Humphry Davy at London's prestigious Royal Institution. He took copious and careful notes, and, in the hopes of landing a scientific job, bound them and sent them to the lecturer. Davy was impressed enough to hire the 21-year-old as a laboratory assistant.<br><br>In his first decade at the Institution, Faraday discovered benzene, isobutylene, and two chlorides of carbon. But despite these and other accomplishments in chemistry, he is chiefly remembered for his work in physics. In 1831 he proved that magnetism could generate an electric current, thereby establishing the field of electromagnetism and leading to the invention of the dynamo. In addition to his extraordinary scientific activities, Faraday was a leader in his church, whose faith and wish to serve guided him throughout his career. An engaging public speaker, he gave popular lectures on scientific subjects, and helped found a tradition of scientific education for children and laypeople that continues to this day. <br><br><em>Oxford Portraits in Science</em> is an ongoing series of scientific biographies for young adults. Written by top scholars and writers, each biography examines the personality of its subject as well as the thought process leading to his or her discoveries. These illustrated biographies combine accessible technical information with compelling personal stories to portray the scientists whose work has shaped our understanding of the natural world.<br></p><p>Colin A. Russell is at The Open University, Milton Keynes, England.<p>Gr 8 Up-The significance of the work of this 19th-century British scientist is well thought out in this biography. Most noted for his invention of the electric transformer and the dynamo, Faraday is also credited with the electric motor. The son of a blacksmith, he spent his teen years as a bookbinder's apprentice but his love of science led him to the Royal Institution in London. Experiments with whale oil and gases produced from it led to the discovery of benzene, now used in many useful substances. He remained loyal to his Sandemanian church, a sect known for its strict moral principles. This book, while trying its best to personalize this scientist, does a better job of describing Faraday's work in the context of the times in which he lived. Mature readers will appreciate a beginning chapter about London in the late 1700s in which a science lecture was as well attended as an opera. The way in which scientific etiquette affected Faraday's progression of experiments is complex but fascinating. A sample lecture, document reproductions, and excerpts from letters will satisfy a need for primary-source material.-Vicki Reutter, Cazenovia High School, NY</p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Einstein&#39;s Space and Van Gogh&#39;s Sky: Physical Reality and Beyond</h2><p>An evaluation of the methodology and perspectives of modern science explains how discoveries in the physical sciences require and anticipate a revolutionary, philosophical interpretation of reality</p><p></p><h2>Canine and Feline Endocrinology and Reproduction</h2><p>A concise source of information on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of endocrine, metabolic, and reproductive diseases in dogs and cats.

The source of much of his published writing, the Journal is also a record of both his interior life and his monumental studies of the natural history of his native Concord, Massachusetts. In contrast to earlier editions, the Princeton Edition reproduces the Journal in its original and complete form, in a reading text that is free of editorial interpolations but keyed to a comprehensive scholarly apparatus.</p><br><p> This volume spans a period of rapid change in Thoreau's life and literary career, including the publication of his first book and a crisis in his friendship with Emerson, during which the Journal assumes its mature form as the extensive, regular, and dated record of his studies of and reflections on the natural and human life of the Concord region.</p></p><p><p>Henry David Thoreau was born in 1817 in Concord, Massachusetts. He spent time as a school teacher after attending Harvard College but was dismissed for his refusal to administer corporal punishment. In 1845, wanting to write his first book, he moved to Walden Pond and built his cabin on land owned by Ralph Waldo Emerson. It was during his time at Walden that Thoreau was imprisoned briefly for not paying taxes; this experience became the basis for his well-known essay "Civil Disobedience." He died of tuberculosis in 1862 at the age of 44.</p></p><h2>Art Nouveau</h2><p>Art Nouveau. Reconciling the Irreconcilable <p>Art Nouveau, whose emergence at the same time as cinema was no mere coincidence, represents the most remarkable attempt to reconcile the demands of the technical age with the undying wish for beauty and glorification - or to pit the one against the other. </p><p>Under the title "Art Nouveau - Utopia: Reconciling the Irreconcilable" the reform movement of the turn of the century is not only dealt with as an artistic event, but those economic and political interests which inspired, supported and handicapped it are also taken into account. </p><p>In the chapters "Movement", "Unrest" and "Equilibrium" the historical phenomenon as a whole is characterised and is also presented with its own distinct local features. The centres of Brussels, Nancy, Barcelona, Glasgow, Helsinki and Chicago are dealt with in subchapters as are Munich, Darmstadt and Weimar. Finally, Vienna, that city in which the synthesis achieved its culmination, is described separately. </p><p>The outstanding artists are dealt with in detail in connection with the respective cities of their greatest activity.

He is the author of A Coronary Event and Media Unbound, among other books.To his opponents on the left, George Wallace was the b{&#x2c6;}ete noire of their nightmares: a race-baiting demagogue whose snarling contempt portended a chilling brand of populist authoritarianism. To his supporters, Wallace was a straight-talking, decisive politician who promised to remember those whom a swollen federal government had long neglected--"average, hard working American[s]." As Lesher illustrates, the reality of Wallace was far more complicated. Lesher views him as a fascinating, charismatic, and enigmatic political figure whose influence on national politics<p>far exceeded his modest vote totals in the elections of 1968 and 1972. Lesher traces Wallace's personal and political development from his youth in dirt-poor Barbour County to his metamorphosis into a respected southern moderate of the New South. Along the way, Lesher reveals a man of toughness, competitive fire, and a surprising capacity for growth and compassion. Above all, Lesher's Wallace is a product of the Deep South, with its sense of pride and victimization always present in Wallace's personal and political psyche. For anyone who wishes to understand the current political and cultural schisms in America, Lesher's biography provides an invaluable service. <i>Jay Freeman</i></p></p><h2>Contemporary Linguistics</h2><p><p>This book is a comprehensive, fully up-to-date introduction to linguistics.

Beginning with a dramatic account of the SARS pandemic at the start of the 21st century, Dorothy Crawford takes us back in time to follow the interlinked history of microbes and humanity, offering an up-to-date look at ancient plagues and epidemics, and identifying key changes in the way humans have lived--such as our move from hunter-gatherer to farmer to city-dweller--which made us ever more vulnerable to microbe attack. Showing that how we live our lives today--with increased crowding and air travel--puts us once again at risk, Crawford asks whether we might ever conquer microbes completely. Among the possible answers, one thing becomes clear: that for generations to come, our deadly companions will continue to influence our lives. <br><br><strong>New in Paperback</strong></p><p><br><strong>Dorothy Crawford</strong> is Professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Edinburgh, where she is also Assistant Principal for the Public Understanding of Medicine.

Far from a call to arms, or a &#x201c;how-to&#x201d; manual for warfare, this volume offers histories, reflections, and questions about the role of firearms in small collective defense efforts and its place in larger efforts toward the creation of autonomy and liberation. Featuring diverse perspectives from movements across the globe, <i>Setting Sights</i> includes vivid histories and personal reflections from both researchers and those who participated in community armed self-defense.

What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>Rites of Passage: A Novel (To the Ends of the Earth, 1)</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the 1980 Booker Prize</b></p><p>Sailing to Australia in the early years of the nineteenth century, Edmund Talbot keeps a journal to amuse his godfather back in England.

Cameron Hay, Miami University; author, Remembering to Live: Illness at the Intersection of Anxiety and Knowledge in Rural Indonesia)<br><br>Editors Bernard and Gravlee focus on the core aspect: fieldwork. The second edition of this handbook is organized into four parts: 'Perspectives,' 'Acquiring Information,' 'Interpreting Information,' and 'Applying and Presenting Information. The 23 chapters were each separately authored; some are by well-known anthropologists and others by those not so well-known. All have lengthy reference lists. . . .Nevertheless, the excellent essays certainly will be of use to experts wanting to expand their repertoire and to novices. Contributors cover topics ranging from epistemology to survey methods and from the classic participant observation to contemporary fieldwork in online environments.

Kevin Aho draws on a wide range of existentialist thinkers in chapters centering on the key themes of freedom, being-in-the-world, alienation, nihilism, anxiety and authenticity. He also addresses important but often overlooked issues in the canon of existentialism, with discussions devoted to the role of embodiment, the movement&#x2019;s contribution to ethics, politics, and environmental and comparative philosophies, as well as its influence on contemporary psychiatry and psychotherapy. The enduring relevance of existentialism is shown by applying existentialist ideas to contemporary philosophical discussions of interest to a wide audience. The book covers secular thinkers such as Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Nietzsche, Sartre, Camus, and Beauvoir as well as religious authors, such as Buber, Dostoevsky, Marcel, and Kierkegaard. <br> <br> In this engaging and accessible text Aho shows why existentialism cannot be easily dismissed as a moribund or outdated movement. In the aftermath of 'God&#x2019;s death', existentialist philosophy engages questions with lasting philosophical significance, questions such as 'Who am I?' and 'How should I live?' By showing how existentialism offers insight into what it means to be human, the author illuminates existentialism&#x2019;s enduring value.<br> <br> <i>Existentialism: An Introduction</i> provides the ideal introduction for upper level students and anyone interested in knowing more about one of the most vibrant and important areas of philosophy today.</p><p>Kevin Aho is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Florida Gulf Coast University."Surely the best overview of the movement available today. Aho clarifies the place of existentialist philosophy in world thought, carefully and fairly examines all its major figures, and shows its relations to recent thought and movements. With his clear and energetic writing, Aho brings existentialism to life."<br><b>Charles Guignon, University of South Florida</b><br><br>"Historically comprehensive and philosophically acute, Kevin Aho's <i>Existentialism</i> is a wonderful introduction to the '-ism' that isn't, to 'the noth-ing' that burst forth in philosophy and literature like a series of coordinated attacks on existing reality, exposing the hollow core of modernity and thereby opening up our future."<br><b>Iain Thomson, University of New Mexico</b><br><br>"Kevin Aho's book is a commendable effort to show why existentialism is still relevant today as a tool of understanding what it means to be a human being in the world. Drawing from the writings of the giants of existentialist thought, the author makes a compelling argument for the contemporary relevance of the philosophy and why it is useful as a critique of both the modern individual and society. Aho's work provides a lucid account of what needs to be known about existentialism and its protagonists."<br><b>Political Studies Review</b></p><h2>Introduction to Probability Models</h2><p><p><i>Introduction to Probability Models, Tenth Edition,</i> provides an introduction to elementary probability theory and stochastic processes. There are two approaches to the study of probability theory.</p> <p>One is heuristic and nonrigorous, and attempts to develop in students an intuitive feel for the subject that enables him or her to think probabilistically. The other approach attempts a rigorous development of probability by using the tools of measure theory. The first approach is employed in this text.</p> <p>The book begins by introducing basic concepts of probability theory, such as the random variable, conditional probability, and conditional expectation. This is followed by discussions of stochastic processes, including Markov chains and Poison processes. The remaining chapters cover queuing, reliability theory, Brownian motion, and simulation. Many examples are worked out throughout the text, along with exercises to be solved by students.</p> <p>This book will be particularly useful to those interested in learning how probability theory can be applied to the study of phenomena in fields such as engineering, computer science, management science, the physical and social sciences, and operations research. Ideally, this text would be used in a one-year course in probability models, or a one-semester course in introductory probability theory or a course in elementary stochastic processes. </p><p>New to this Edition: </p> <ul> <p></p><li>65% new chapter material including coverage of finite capacity queues, insurance risk models and Markov chains</li><li>Contains compulsory material for new Exam 3 of the Society of Actuaries containing several sections in the new exams</li><li>Updated data, and a list of commonly used notations and equations, a robust ancillary package, including a ISM, SSM, and test bank</li><li>Includes SPSS PASW Modeler and SAS JMP software packages which are widely used in the field</li> </ul> <p>Hallmark features:</p> <ul> <p></p><li>Superior writing style</li><li>Excellent exercises and examples covering the wide breadth of coverage of probability topics </li><li>Real-world applications in engineering, science, business and economics</li></ul></p><p>Dr. Sheldon M.

What happened when cavalry regiments charged directly at one another? What did the generals do during battle? Drawing on memoirs, diaries, and letters of the time, this dramatic book explores what actually happened in battle and how the participants&#x2019; feelings and reactions influenced the outcome. Rory Muir focuses on the dynamics of combat in the age of Napoleon, enhancing his analysis with vivid accounts of those who were there&#x2015;the frightened foot soldier, the general in command, the young cavalry officer whose boils made it impossible to ride, and the smartly dressed aide-de-camp, tripped up by his voluminous pantaloons. <br><br>This book sheds new light on how military tactics worked by concentrating on the experience of soldiers in the firing line. Muir considers the interaction of artillery, infantry, and cavalry; the role of the general, subordinate commanders, staff officers, and aides; morale, esprit de corps, and the role of regimental officers; soldiers&#x2019; attitudes toward death and feelings about the enemy; the plight of the wounded; the difficulty of surrendering; and the way victories were finally decided. He discusses the mechanics of musketry, artillery, and cavalry charges and shows how they influenced the morale, discipline, and resolution of the opposing armies. This is a volume that will fascinate all readers with an interest in military history, European history, or the psychology of combat.</p><p><b>Rory Muir</b> is a visiting research fellow at the University of Adelaide. He is the author of <i>Britain and the Defeat of Napoleon, 1807-1815</i>, published by Yale University Press.Quite a few books deal with the military aspects of the Napoleonic era, especially campaigns, battles, and tactics, but very few focus on the nature of battle or what actually goes on during battle with any serious analysis. Research fellow Muir (Britain and the Defeat of Napoleon, Yale Univ., 1996) has filled a significant gap in the study of the period with this engaging study of the mechanics of a Napoleonic battle. Muir uses a tremendous number of firsthand accounts to discuss battlefield events, breaking down each into its component parts. A brief discussion of battles and battlefields is followed by a detailed treatment of each army component: artillery, infantry, and cavalry and the nature of their combat roles as reflected in contemporary accounts. In a separate section, the author considers the role played by the generals and their subordinate commanders, rounding out a well-ordered analysis. Strongly recommended for all good history collections.ADavid Lee Poremba, Detroit P.L.<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Landscape Construction</h2><p>Landscape Construction, 2nd Edition will help readers understand the process of construction and implementation of hardscape improvements.

When he learned that the sentencing judge had died, Tolstoy was roused to consider the judge&#x2019;s thoughts during his final days&#x2014;a study on the acceptance of mortality only deepened by the death, during its writing, of one of Tolstoy&#x2019;s own young children.<br><br>The final result is a magisterial story, both chilling and beguiling in the fullness of its empathy, its quotidian detail, and the beauty of its prose, and is, as many have claimed it to be, one of the most moving novellas ever written.<br><br> <b>The Art of The Novella Series<br><br> </b>Too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story, the novella is generally unrecognized by academics and publishers. Nonetheless, it is a form beloved and practiced by literature's greatest writers. In the Art Of The Novella series, Melville House celebrates this renegade art form and its practitioners with titles that are, in many instances, presented in book form for the first time.</p><p><b>Leo Tolstoy</b> was born into the upper levels of the Russian aristocracy (his mother was a princess) in 1828. After a licentious youth, he joined the army to fight in the Crimean War, and published his first novel, <i>Childhood</i>, while serving in an artillery unit. After participating in some of the deadliest battles of the century, such as the Siege of Sebastopol, he quit the military in disgust. But the experience proved the inspiration for some of his greatest writing, including <i>Sebastopol Sketches</i> and <i>War and Peace</i>. After the war, he traveled throughout Europe but was disillusioned by Western materialism and returned to his family estate, Yasnaya Polyana. There, he married, fathered 13 children, founded a school for young peasants, and wrote <i>Anna Karenina</i>. But in 1879 Tolstoy underwent a spiritual crisis, and denounced the Orthodox church, private property, and the demands of the flesh. His extreme asceticism inspired a widespread, cult-like worship, but it also exacerbated a decades-long tension with his wife, Sofia. In 1910, after an argument with her, he fled the estate, only to die shortly thereafter at the nearby railroad station.<br><br> <b>Ian Dreiblatt</b> translates from the Russian, Latin, Yiddish, and Amharic.

Based on the author's many years of experience in construction, engineering, and education, it is believed that the material presented is comprehensive enough to serve as the basic text for a variety of construction courses as well as for self-study. For an introductory course, upper-division college-level students should be able to cover much of the material in one semester. For more in-depth coverage, the material should be split between two or more courses. Topics may, of course, be omitted or augmented as appropriate to the nature of the course and the desires of the instructor. In solving the computer problems contained in the end-of-chapter exercises, students should be encouraged to use electronic spreadsheets and their associated functions in addition to conventional computer programming languages. It is strongly recommended that the study of this text in an academic environment be supplemented by visits to construction projects and/or audiovisual material. </p> <p> The author is convinced that all architecture and civil engineering students should be required to complete a basic course in construction as part of their professional studies. Because construction is the product of all design, no design can be a good one unless it can be readily and safely constructed. An appreciation of construction procedures will not only produce a better designer, but it will also be invaluable to the many graduates of such programs who end up directly involved in the construction industry. </p> <p> In response to industry developments and user comments, this sixth edition incorporates new and revised material to reflect current developments in the construction industry. New and expanded topics include construction use of the Internet (including the web addresses of major online resources), pull scrapers, rental equipment and the rental equipment industry, fire-retardant-treated wood and wood preservation, Superpave asphalt pavement, rapid repair of concrete pavements, hot- and cold-weather masonry construction, the cryogenic treatment of high-wear equipment components, and precautions in safely craning wood trusses, in addition to updated text, illustrations, and references. </p> <p> It would not be possible to produce a book of this type without the assistance of many individuals and organizations.

Otto takes us on a journey around the world in search of one of the most colorful characters in history&#x2014;the court jester. Though not always clad in cap and bells, these witty, quirky characters crop up everywhere, from the courts of ancient China and the Mogul emperors of India to those of medieval Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas. With a wealth of anecdotes, jokes, quotations, epigraphs, and illustrations (including flip art), Otto brings to light little-known jesters, highlighting their humanizing influence on people with power and position and placing otherwise remote historical figures in a more idiosyncratic, intimate light.<br> <br> Most of the work on the court jester has concentrated on Europe; Otto draws on previously untranslated classical Chinese writings and other sources to correct this bias and also looks at jesters in literature, mythology, and drama. Written with wit and humor, <i>Fools Are Everywhere</i> is the most comprehensive look at these roguish characters who risked their necks not only to mock and entertain but also to fulfill a deep and widespread human and social need.</p></p><p><b>Beatrice K. Otto</b><b></b>lives and works in Geneva.Mention a court jester, and one pictures a whimsical creature in a belled hat or, perhaps, the ill-fated character in King Lear. Otto's lively, well-researched text proves that there are centuries of other examples and that the jester has a rich tradition worldwide. Recounting stories about jesters from You Zhan of the Qin dynasty (third century B.C.E.) to Gabriel La Mena of 16th-century Spain, Otto defines the many facets of the roleDone who provides amusement, wit, diversion, advice, entertainment, companionship, undying loyalty, and more. Through anecdotes, historical details, analyses, and commentary, Otto brilliantly delineates the court jester, and quotations and illustrations do much to enhance this eminently readable text. She also discusses stage and literature portrayals and draws parallels to modern versions of the character, such as Will Rogers and Groucho Marx. The appendix contains a table of jesters and the courts, dates, and countries with which they were associated. Although intended for a scholarly audience, this is well worth a look by avid readers with an eye for an informative yet uncommon title.DCarol J.

It&#x2019;s not a job title one can give oneself, and in indigenous societies, a shaman is usually born to this role. Ya&#x2019;Acov Darling Khan is one of the few westerners who have been acknowledged as shamans by indigenous elders or teachers.After being hit by lightning, Ya&#x2019;Acov took a 30-year journey into the heart of shamanism to seek his own healing, and to learn how he could serve others with the wisdom he acquired through his experiences. He has studied with indigenous teachers from the Arctic Circle to the USA and South America, and has taken part in ceremonies in such diverse locations as Welsh caves to the depths of the Amazon rainforest. Nowadays, Ya&#x2019;Acov continues to study and regularly journeys to the Ecuadorean Amazon to work alongside the Achuar and S�para people.For thousands of years, shamans helped the people in their communities remain in balance with themselves, each other, the natural world and the spirit world. This beautifully written book is not only a powerfully honest, humorous and inspiring memoir, but a guidebook for those from many cultures and walks of life wishing to return to their indigenous roots, and be part of midwifing a more benign human presence here on Earth as part of a new dream.</p><p>Ya&#x2019;Acov Darling Khan is a modern-day shaman, who has studied and practiced with many gifted teachers around the world.

Before him opened a vast hole, some 200 meters wide and deep, teeming with tens of thousands of barely-clothed men. Half of them carried sacks weighing up to 40 kilograms up wooden ladders, the others leaping down muddy slopes back into the cavernous maw. Their bodies and faces were the color of ochre, stained by the iron ore in the earth they had excavated.</p><p>After gold was discovered in one of its streams in 1979, Serra Pelada evoked the long-promised El Dorado as the world&#x2019;s largest open-air gold mine, employing some 50,000 diggers in appalling conditions. Today, Brazil&#x2019;s wildest gold rush is merely the stuff of legend, kept alive by a few happy memories, many pained regrets&#x2015;and Sebasti�o Salgado&#x2019;s photographs.</p><p>Color dominated the glossy pages of magazines when Salgado shot these images. Black and white was a risky path, but the Serra Pelada portfolio would mark a return to the grace of monochrome photography, following a tradition whose masters, from Edward Weston and Brassa� to Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson, had defined the early and mid-20th century. When Salgado&#x2019;s images reached The New York Times Magazine, something extraordinary happened: there was complete silence. &#x201c;In my entire career at The New York Times,&#x201d; recalled photo editor Peter Howe, &#x201c;I never saw editors react to any set of pictures as they did to Serra Pelada.&#x201d;</p><p>Today, with photography absorbed by the art world and digital manipulation, Salgado&#x2019;s portfolio holds a biblical quality and projects an immediacy that makes them vividly contemporary. The mine at Serra Pelada has been long closed, yet the intense drama of the gold rush leaps out of these images.</p><p>This book gathers Salgado&#x2019;s complete Serra Pelada portfolio in museum-quality reproductions, accompanied by a foreword by the photographer and an essay by Alan Riding.Also available in a signed and limited Collector&#x2019;s Edition and as an Art Edition.</p></p><p>Sebasti�o Salgado began his career as a professional photographer in Paris in 1973 and subsequently worked with the photo agencies Sygma, Gamma, and Magnum Photos. In 1994 he and his wife L�lia Wanick Salgado created Amazonas Images, which exclusively handles his work. Salgado&#x2019;s photographic projects have been featured in many exhibitions as well as books, including Sahel, L'Homme en d�tresse (1986), Other Americas (1986), Workers (1993), Terra (1997), Migrations (2000), The Children (2000), Africa (2007), Genesis (2013), The Scent of a Dream (2015), and Kuwait, A Desert on Fire (2016).<br><br>Alan Riding is a Brazilian-born British author and former long-time foreign correspondent for The New York Times. Having served as the paper&#x2019;s bureau chief in Mexico, Brazil, and France as well as its European arts correspondent, he is now writing for the theatre. A resident of Paris like Sebasti�o Salgado, the two have been friends and collaborators since the early 1980s.<br><br>L�lia Wanick Salgado studied architecture and urban planning in Paris. Her interest in photography started in 1970. In the 1980s she began conceiving and designing the majority of Sebasti�o Salgado&#x2019;s photography books and all the exhibitions of his work. L�lia Wanick Salgado has been the director of Amazonas Images since 1994.</p><h2>Shades of Freedom: Racial Politics and Presumptions of the American Legal Process</h2><p>Few individuals have had as great an impact on the law--both its practice and its history--as A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr. A winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, he has distinguished himself over the decades both as a professor at Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard, and as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals. But Judge Higginbotham is perhaps best known as an authority on racism in America: not the least important achievement of his long career has been <em>In the Matter of Color</em>, the first volume in a monumental history of race and the American legal process. Published in 1978, this brilliant book has been hailed as the definitive account of racism, slavery, and the law in colonial America.<br> Now, after twenty years, comes the long-awaited sequel. In <em>Shades of Freedom</em>, Higginbotham provides a magisterial account of the interaction between the law and racial oppression in America from colonial times to the present, demonstrating how the one agent that should have guaranteed equal treatment before the law--the judicial system--instead played a dominant role in enforcing the inferior position of blacks. The issue of racial inferiority is central to this volume, as Higginbotham documents how early white perceptions of black inferiority slowly became codified into law. Perhaps the most powerful and insightful writing centers on a pair of famous Supreme Court cases, which Higginbotham uses to portray race relations at two vital moments in our history. The <em>Dred Scott</em> decision of 1857 declared that a slave who had escaped to free territory must be returned to his slave owner. Chief Justice Roger Taney, in his notorious opinion for the majority, stated that blacks were "so inferior that they had no right which the white man was bound to respect." For Higginbotham, Taney's decision reflects the extreme state that race relations had reached just before the Civil War. And after the War and Reconstruction, Higginbotham reveals, the Courts showed a pervasive reluctance (if not hostility) toward the goal of full and equal justice for African Americans, and this was particularly true of the Supreme Court. And in the <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> decision, which Higginbotham terms "one of the most catastrophic racial decisions ever rendered," the Court held that full equality--in schooling or housing, for instance--was unnecessary as long as there were "separate but equal" facilities. Higginbotham also documents the eloquent voices that opposed the openly racist workings of the judicial system, from Reconstruction Congressman John R. Lynch to Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan to W. E. B. Du Bois, and he shows that, ironically, it was the conservative Supreme Court of the 1930s that began the attack on school segregation, and overturned the convictions of African Americans in the famous Scottsboro case. But today racial bias still dominates the nation, Higginbotham concludes, as he shows how in six recent court cases the public perception of black inferiority continues to persist.<br> In <em>Shades of Freedom</em>, a noted scholar and celebrated jurist offers a work of magnificent scope, insight, and passion. Ranging from the earliest colonial times to the present, it is a superb work of history--and a mirror to the American soul.<br></p><p><br><strong>A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr.</strong> is Public Service Professor of Jurisprudence at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, and Of Counsel to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, &amp; Garrison. He was formerly Chief Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and is a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. His landmark volume, <em>In the Matter of Color</em>, won the American Bar Association's Silver Gavel Award and the National Bar Association's Literary Award.<br><br>"By showing us how profound our struggle has been, and how far we have come, Higginbotham also has shown by implication how difficult the struggles ahead are bound to be."--<em>Emerge</em><p></p><br>"A carefully researched and impressively documented book...Insightful."--<em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"An important exploration of some of the most critical and difficult terrain in American history."--<em>The Washington Times</em><p></p><br>"<em>Shades of Freedom</em> is Leon Higginbotham's masterpiece. It exhibits a towering intellect, a peerless capacity for potent articulation, an unbending integrity and rich reservoirs of deep compassion all coalescing in a dance of incredible beauty and energy."--Justice I Mahomed, Chief Justice of Namibia, Chairperson of the South African Law Commission, Deputy President of the Constitutional Court of South Africa<p></p><br>"Every course in American history must now include as required reading Judge Higginbotham's superb treatment of the legal process from 1619 to the modern era. In <em>Shades of Freedom</em>, as the author concentrates on 'The Precept of Inferiority,' the first of ten precepts which will portray the historical treatment of blacks in America, we are exposed to a kaleidoscope of official conduct--legislative, executive, but especially judicial--that must not be glossed over as a series of past events, but preserved and understood as true recordation of our history."--Ruggero J. Aldisert, Senior Circuit Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit<p></p><br>"In 1978, Judge A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., published <em>In the Matter of Color</em>, a meticulous examination of how white Americans used law in aid of slavery in the Colonial period. It was a pathbreaking scholarly achievement. 18 years later, judge-turned-professor Higginbotham has produced an impressive sequel to his earlier work. It was worth the wait. <em>Shades of Freedom</em> starts the process (at least one further volume is in early prospect) of bringing the tangled tale of race and law--and of the overarching cultural precepts which govern their interaction--up to date."--Lewis H. Pollak, U.S. District Judge<p></p><br>"One of the nation's leading constitutional scholars demonstrates, with a powerful command of history, the corrosive effects that centuries of racism have had on American justice. Judge Higginbotham's book is a milestone in the continuing effort to understand the manner in which racism has compromised the capacity of law to achieve equal justice for every citizen."--James O. Freedman, President, Dartmouth College<p></p><br>"Leon Higginbotham's <em>Shades of Freedom</em> is a testament to the great tradition of liberal jurisprudence that characterized the crucial legal aspect of the civil rights movement. Alone among the legal minds that comprised that movement, Judge Higginbotham has chronicled the long history of the idea of race in legal discourse, establishing himself as the major scholar of this field, as well as the logical heir of Mr. Justice Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court."--Henry Louis Gates, Jr., W.E.B. Du Bois Professor of the Humanities, Harvard University<p></p><br>"Judge Higginbotham's book is customarily well researched, extensively documented, persuasively written, and offers compelling insights on the painfully slow process of racial progress in America. While W.E.B. Du Bois reminded us that the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line, Judge Higginbotham has documented Du Bois's prophecy in <em>Shades of Freedom</em>, the seminal work on race in the legal system for the twenty-first century."--Charles J. Ogletree, Professor of Law, Harvard Law School<p></p><br>"In his powerful treatise, Judge Higginbotham has exposed both the pathology and the potential of the law in either eliminating or perpetuating racial injustice. He has written with the eloquence of a Martin Luther King, the scholarship of a W.E.B. Du Bois, and the superb legal craftsmanship and wisdom of Chief Justice Warren and Thurgood Marshall. For all individuals who believe that history is relevant, <em>Shades of Freedom</em> must be read and reflected on. A must-read book for every generation of Americans."--Kweisi Mfume, President &amp; CEO, NAACP<p></p><br>"<em>Shades of Freedom</em> is a worthy successor to <em>In the Matter of Color</em>. With eloquence and authority, Judge Higginbotham chronicles and analyzes the long, sordid history of the use of law in establishing and maintaining a system in which 'Equal Justice Under Law' is a mockery of the actual practice. Anyone interested in race in America should read this important book."--John Hope Franklin, James B. Duke Professor of History Emeritus, Duke University<p></p><br>"<em>Shades of Freedom</em> magnificently reflects on the systematic denial and betrayal of our past and present rights to full liberty and justice, while providing a sobering and disturbing prognosis of our future progress in achieving our full Constitutional guarantees. It superimposes a historical mosaic of denial and unkept promises. The Judge brilliantly chronicles the insidious patterns of racism that have always short-circuited our quest for unconditional freedom, as embraced by America's most enduring concept 'We the People.' In <em>Shades of Freedom</em>, as in <em>In the Matter of Color</em>, Judge Higginbotham passionately sounds the trumpet for a Rainbow of Freedom for 'We the People.'"--Dr. C. DeLores Tucker, President/Founder, The Bethune-Du Bois Fund<p></p><br>"Judge Higginbotham is once again the smithy, wielding, as a mighty hammer, his powerful intellect, scholarship, historical, and logic, in the forge of justice, seeking to reshape on the anvil of the Constitution, minds badly twisted by racism. In this classic work, <em>Shades of Freedom</em>, Higginbotham takes his readers through historical and social time zones with their sunlight and shadows, showing forward movement and retreat. Given the confused state of race relations today this remarkable book could not be more timely."--Honorable Nathaniel R. Jones, United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit<p></p><br>"Higginbotham's masterful work is a compelling and convincing examination of how the law developed the official American doctrine of racial inferiority."--Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton<p></p><br>"Once again, this great freedom fighter, A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., has masterfully presented a remarkable and refreshingly honest assessment of the role of race in American society and law. With great clarity and perception, Higginbotham exposes underlying cultural assumptions of inferiority and the impact such assumptions have on our collective progress. <em>Shades of Freedom</em> is aptly entitled because in describing the vast spectrum of freedoms enjoyed by African Americans today, it serves as a poignant reminder that there are many miles yet to travel on the road to freedom and equality."--Honorable Damon J. Keith, United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit<p></p><br>"In my lifetime, two giants of the bench did not make the Supreme Court: Learned Hand and Leon Higginbotham. Now one has written a book that you would expect from him: eloquent, scholarly, compassionate, and a ringing call for justice."--Senator Paul Simon<p></p><br>"In <em>Shades of Freedom</em> one of our greatest legal minds makes a powerful case for turning the use of law to the service of justice. Judge Higginbotham carefully explains the role of law in reinforcing the concept of African American inferiority since the colonial period."--Mary Frances Berry, University of Pennsylvania, and Chairperson, United States Commission on Civil Rights<p></p><br>"Eighteen years is a long time to hold one's breath, but it has been worth the pain and effort. <em>Shades of Freedom</em> is in its own way as remarkable a book as Leon Higginbotham's magnificent <em>In The Matter of Color</em>. It reflects the same mastery of historical research, passion for equality and the rule of law, and judicial temperament. With the publication of this volume, Judge Higginbotham confirms my judgement that he is our leading judicial scholar, and my hope that, with his leadership, this nation will resume its progress toward equal protection of the law for all."--Stanley N. Katz, President, American Council for Learned Societies, and Professor, The Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University<p></p><br>"After groundbreaking work <em>In the Matter of Color</em>, which covered racism, slavery and the law in colonial America, in <em>Shades of Freedom,</em> the author provides a thorough account of the interaction between the law and racial oppression from colonial times to the present."--JFK School of Government<p></p><br>"By showing us how profound our struggle has been, and how far we have come, Higginbotham also has shown by implication how difficult the struggles ahead are bound to be. The major lesson of this book is that it is folly to go into those struggles without a sound knowledge of our cultural and legal history. If we heed higginbotham--a wise teacher as well as a great judge--we shall not face the future unarmed."--Roger Wilkins in <em>Emerge</em><p></p><br><em>Shades of Freedom</em> is a carefully researched and impressivly documented book. It contains insightful chapters on the ancestry, ideology and politics of the idea of racial inferiority as well as thought sections of the Supreme Court's legitimization of racism...Mr. Higginbotham writers clearly, briskly and with controlled passion. And he writes with power and style."--<em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"On the whole, particularly for those who believe the U.S. Supreme Court has been a longtime friend of African-Americans, this book offers a sobering perspective. The author marshals as impressive volume of cases that could easily lead the reader to despair that the United States will ever become a fair multicultural society.Yet, this is a book for optimists."--<em>The National Law Review</em><p></p><br>"Mr. Higginbotham's concern with the idology of black inferiority and its influence on American law has led him on an important exploration of some of the most critical and difficult terrain in American history."--<em>The Washington Times</em><p></p><br>"<em>Shades of Freedom</em> enriches our understanding of the history that we canot escape and encourages us to take responsibility for our future."--Judith A.

He may be considered a third-generation Arts and Crafts architect, who joined the movement after it had become well established and took its ideas to everyman. He invented a new type of small house by opening up a plan around a spacious house-place or hall and extending the interior into the garden. These airy little houses, with their intimate alcoves and sunny verandas, captured William Morris&#x2019;s vision: &#x2018;Simplicity of life, even the barest, is not a misery, but the very foundation of refinement: a sanded floor and whitewashed walls, and the green trees, and flowery meads... will turn all &#x201c;operatives&#x201d; into workmen, into artists, into men.&#x2019; <p>It is clear that Baillie Scott made a significant contribution to twentieth-century architecture. The&nbsp; main themes of his agenda &#x2013; the development of alternative small houses for the average householder; open and spacious planning, continuity of internal and external space, exploration of the rich textures of materials &#x2013; are as important today as they were in the early years of the century. The work of Baillie Scott effectively ensured an important and enduring relevance for Morris&#x2019;s legacy.</p> <p>This book includes many newly commissioned photographs of Baillie Scott&#x2019;s houses, as well as original drawing and new research.

Drawing on oral histories, police reports, newspaper accounts, and vintage recordings, Charles Hersch brings to vivid life the neighborhoods and nightspots where jazz was born. </p><p>This volume shows how musicians such as Jelly Roll Morton, Nick La Rocca, and Louis Armstrong negotiated New Orleans&#x2019;s complex racial rules to pursue their craft and how, in order to widen their audiences, they became fluent in a variety of musical traditions from diverse ethnic sources. These encounters with other music and races subverted their own racial identities and changed the way they played&#x2014;a musical miscegenation that, in the shadow of Jim Crow, undermined the pursuit of racial purity and indelibly transformed American culture.</p><p>&#x201c;More than timely . . .

(William Howland Kenney, author of Jazz on the River 2007-03-05)<br><br>"A provocative new history. . . . Hersch illuminates how musicians of color drew from realities that few white people experienced in forging a form of dance music for people of both races. In that sense, <i>Subversive Sounds</i> is more than timely. . .&nbsp;. Tapping oral histories from the Hogan Jazz Archive at Tulane, Hersch orchestrates voices of musicians on both sides of the racial divide in underscoring how porous the music made the boundaries of race and class.

Now in its fifth edition, this historically organized introductory text treats philosophy as a dramatic and continuous story--a conversation about humankind's deepest and most persistent concerns. Tracing the exchange of ideas between history's key philosophers, the book demonstrates that while constructing an argument or making a claim, one philosopher almost always has others in mind. It addresses the fundamental questions of human life: Who are we? What can we know? How should we live? and What sort of reality do we inhabit?<br> The fifth edition retains the distinctive feature of previous editions: Melchert provides a generous selection of excerpts from major philosophical works and makes them more easily understandable to students with his own lucid and engaging explanations. Ranging from Descartes to Derrida and Quine, the selections are organized historically and include a translation of Descartes'<em>Meditations on First Philosophy</em> (the complete work). The author's commentary offers a rich intellectual and cultural context for the philosophical ideas conveyed in the excerpts. Extensive cross-referencing shows students how philosophers respond appreciatively or critically to the thoughts of other philosophers. The text is enhanced by two types of exercises--"Basic Questions" and "For Further Thought"--and more than thirty illustrations.<br> <br> <strong>New to the Fifth Edition</strong><br> <br> * A new chapter (25) on Simone de Beauvoir and her contributions to philosophy<br> * New profiles of the Buddha and Jean-Jacques Rousseau<br> * Review questions that are now dispersed throughout the chapters (instead of at chapter ends) to follow relevant passages and facilitate classroom discussion<br> * Six new images, including explanatory cartoons that help students understand key concepts<br> * A revised Instructor's Manual and Test Bank containing essential points, teaching suggestions, and multiple-choice, short-answer, and essay exam questions<br> <br> <strong>Also available to suit your course needs:</strong> <em>The Great Conversation: A Historical Introduction to Philosophy</em>, Fifth Edition (combined volume covering the Pre-Socratics through Derrida and Quine) and <em>The Great Conversation: Volume I: Pre-Socratics through Descartes</em>, Fifth Edition (includes chapters 1-13 of the combined volume).</p><p>Norman Melchert is at Virginia Commonwealth University (Emeritus).<br>"Melchert's book is unquestionably the best philosophy textbook I have ever read. My students love the book. Melchert writes with utter clarity and his examples are superb. His careful choice of primary sources and brilliant use of them in his prose is nothing short of genius. I generally cringe at the wooden writing style of textbooks, and find some philosophy texts particularly deadly. Melchert's text shatters all of my textbook nightmares." --Thomas Bell, <em>Brevard College</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Player Piano Servicing and Rebuilding: A Treatise on How Player Pianos Function and How to Get Them Back into Top Playing Condition if They Don&#39;t Work</h2><p>For beginners and experienced technicians alike.</p><p></p><h2>Understanding Child Development - Standalone Book</h2><p>This book is a standalone book and will not include any access codes.

A zealous advocate for the small investor for more than fifty years, Bogle has championed the restoration of integrity in industry practices. As an astute observer and commentator, he knows that a trustworthy business and financial complex is essential to America&#x2019;s continuing leadership in the world and to social and economic progress at home.<br><br> This book tells not just a story about what went wrong but, more important, the story of why we lost our way and of how we can right our course. Bogle argues for a return to a governance structure in which owners&#x2019; capital that has been put at risk is used in their interests rather than in the interests of corporate and financial managers. Given that ownership is now consolidated in the hands of relatively few large mutual and pension funds, the specific reforms Bogle details in this book are essential as well as practical. Every investor, analyst, Wall-Streeter, policy maker, and businessperson should read this deeply informed book.</p><p>Q: You say that individual investors have paid a heavy price for the abuses that occurred within the corporate, investment and mutual fund communities during the past few years. In what ways?<p></p><i>A: Individual investors have incurred high losses by paying excessive costs for executive compensation and purchasing overpriced stocks from option-enriched executives and entrepreneurs. Investors have also sacrificed returns by paying excessive management and marketing fees to funds that have delivered market-inferior returns. These costs can deprive investors of as much as 75 percent of the potential longterm returns available in the stock market simply by owning an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund.<p></p></i>Q: Despite the problems you point to in the book, you remain optimistic about the future. What are some of the things that make you hopeful?<p></p><i>A: Progressive public policy has begun to move toward the creation of a better world for investors, with laws and regulations designed to enhance the accuracy of financial statements, to increase the responsibilities of directors, and to give owners opportunities to ensure that their interests are served. However, the greatest reforms will come when an even better educated and informed investing public takes action in its own enlightened self interest.<p></p></i>Q: If you were to distill your book down to a few key messages, what would those be?<p></p><i>A: It is time to abandon the managers&#x2019; capitalism that has shaken our society&#x2019;s belief in the fairness of the system and return to the owners&#x2019; capitalism that built our nation. We need to build independent boards of directors who will provide prudent stewardship of the assets of the owners. We need the new controlling stockholders of corporate America the mutual and pension funds to act responsibly and solely in the interests of their investors. We need to create far more efficient systems for retirement savings that assure investors and beneficiaries of their fair share of market returns. To begin these tasks, we need to form an independent federal commission to evaluate our new agency society, with a view toward restoring fiduciary duty and trust as its objective.<p></p></i><p><b>John C.

It also uses the Internet as the main example of networks. This all creates a book relevant to those interested in networking today. By starting at the application-layer and working down the protocol stack, this book provides a relevant introduction of important concepts. Based on the rationale that once a reader understands the applications of networks they can understand the network services needed to support these applications, this book takes a &#34;top-down&#34; approach that exposes readers first to a concrete application and then draws into some of the deeper issues surrounding networking.

Outnumbered and on the defensive, Earth made a desperate decision. It would attack the aliens not from space, but on the ground&#x2014;with forces the Trofts did not even suspect. Thus were created the Cobras, a guerilla force whose weapons were surgically implanted, invisible to the unsuspecting eye, yet undeniably deadly. And the Moreau family were the most famous of the Cobra warriors. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long after victory over the Troft was achieved, the Cobras made common cause against their former adversaries against a new enemy. Their reward was three planets that would be a home for the Cobras, whose deadly powers made them too dangerous to feel at home on Earth. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, years had passed and not everyone on the Cobra worlds thought that the Cobras were worth the high cost of providing their training and maintaining their existing built-in weaponry, let alone supporting research to improve the Cobra weapons, and possibly even put an end to the negative effects of that built-in weaponry, which caused Cobras to die much too young. Many who had never known interplanetary war were convinced that the Cobras were not needed at all. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a grave miscalculation, because a new menace was approaching, one that even the formidable Cobra warriors might not be able to defeat . . . </p><p></p></p><p><p><b> </b></p><b>Timothy Zahn is a Hugo Award-winner, and author of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>Heir to the Empire</i>. Born in Chicago, he earned a B.S. in physics from Michigan State University and an M.S. in physics from the University of Illinois. He sold his first story to <i>Analog</i> in 1978, and immediately attracted attention as a new writer of science fiction based on real, cutting-edge science. Baen recently published his popular Cobra trilogy in one volume. His other popular series include the &#x201c;Conqueror&#x201d; and &#x201c;Dragonback&#x201d; novels. Zahn has written over twenty novels.</b><p></p><p></p>Zahn's Cobras (last seen in 1988's <i>Cobra Bargain</i>) deliver superb action and jolting interplanetary plots that almost compensate for conventional characters and well-worn motivations. The alien Trofts have been docile for decades, and the leaders of the Cobra Worlds are starting to wonder whether the nanotech-enhanced Cobra warriors are necessary. Mistrust and fear of the Cobras is burgeoning when a strange message summons second-generation Cobra Jin Moreau Broom and her older son, Merrick, to defend the quasi-Islamic planet Qasama against invading rogue Trofts. Naming the Cobra Worlds after Rome's hills, Zahn emphasizes the stern values of duty, honor, planetary group, and suggests that peace comes only through oft-displayed strength. The rough-and-tumble combat crackles like fingertip laser implants and plays off against Qasaman intrigue, and the psychological tensions surrounding Jin's aging and illness make this a rousing start to a new Cobra trilogy. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Every breathtaking volume in this acclaimed, bestselling collection features magnificent full-color illustrations that enhance each verse, and a renowned scholar&#x2019;s guidance to help children understand and love poetry. There&#x2019;s an introduction to each poem, full annotations that define unfamiliar vocabulary, and fascinating biographical information.The star of this superb new entry in the series is 18th century artist and poet William Blake, who wrote his mystical, spirit-filled verses for children and adults alike. Best known for his masterpieces Songs of Innocence&#x201d; and Songs of Experience&#x201d; both excerpted here he speaks of love, hate, anguish, relief and above all, mercy and the divine image that comforts us. Blake often uses simple, lovely language that young readers can appreciate, as well as animal metaphors; his poems sometimes even come in pairs, with the same subjects seen from different points of view. Professor John Maynard (<i>Poetry for Young People: Alfred Lord Tennyson</i>) provides the excellent biography and notes. Artist Alessandra Cimatoribus contributes richly colored and magically rendered paintings that fully capture the gentleness of The Lamb,&#x201d; the sparkling deep blue sky and angels of Night,&#x201d; and The Tyger,&#x201d; eyes glistening and sharp teeth bared burning bright.</p><p>Grade 5&#x2013;9&#x2014;Packaging Blake for this audience is no small challenge. The book begins with a heroic attempt to explain some of his themes and philosophy in a four-page introduction. Maynard speaks of the poet with insight, eloquence, and obvious admiration, but his comments are more likely to be appreciated by adults than by children. He prefaces each poem with explanatory comments that are also thought-provoking and illuminating. They are mostly age-appropriate, but at times they go beyond the intellectual range of middle schoolers. Most of the selections are from <i>Songs of Innocence</i> and <i>Songs of Experience</i>. Maynard does not shy away from the fact that many of them have strong Christian images or deal with harsh social themes. The artwork is well matched to the tone of the poems. Cimatoribus's illustrations are at the same time childlike and surreal. The simplified shapes of the figures contrast with the rich, textured colors and reflect the complex nature of the poetry. As a whole, this work does an admirable job of presenting Blake to young people.&#x2014;<i>Donna Cardon, Provo City Library, UT</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.The newest entry in this excellent series offers 31 short poems or very brief extracts from longer ones--enough to provide a sense of Blake's profoundly individual point of view and to turn on readers to his elaborate, fantastical vision of the natural and supernatural realms. Maynard opens with a coherent account of Blake's life and a persuasive explanation of why he is worth knowing, then supplies brief commentary for each poem. He mixes such familiar selections as "The Lamb" and "The Tyger" with less well-known poems, many of which are thematically linked or paired; original spelling is preserved throughout, but unusual words are defined in the margins. The introduction includes just three of Blake's illustrations, but in her own stylized paintings, Cimatoribus effectively captures each poem's mysterious tone and feeling of otherness. <i>John Peters</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

We dig in our heels, fold our arms, and boldly declare that bad is good when it comes to our relationship choices. Despite advice to the contrary, we still insist, &#x201c;She/he pleases me well.&#x201d; If you find yourself thinking any of the following about people you are going out with, you need a dose of God&#x2019;s truth, or you are headed for a fall:<br>� I just know I can fix him/her. We cannot even fix ourselves, that&#x2019;s why we needed a Savior! So how can we fix other folks, especially when they may resist being fixed? God would not give you an unsaved or unhealthy marriage partner to sap <br>all of your energy and render you useless in the kingdom. <br>If your love interest needs work, it&#x2019;s likely to be work he or she should be doing with the Holy Spirit&#x2013;alone. Your presence will only hinder the process. Don&#x2019;t date anyone until God fixes the major issues in that person first!<br>� I&#x2019;ve invested too much time and energy to quit now. We see the Doppler radar screen flashing: severe tornado warning: vacate premises immediately, but we decide to sit tight and see if it will pass. What happens if it doesn&#x2019;t? You may survive&#x2013;though just barely&#x2013;to find that your roof is blown off and it will take years to rebuild.<br>� I&#x2019;m scared of what he/she might do if I leave him/her. You should be more scared of what might happen to your self-esteem, self-respect, and peace of mind if you stay. Your choices are the only ones God holds you responsible for&#x2013;only you can choose what&#x2019;s best for yourself.seeDeut30:19 Lamentations 1:9 warns, She did not consider her destiny; therefore her collapse was awesome. Do what you should do (break up nicely), and trust God to do what He does best (comfort and restore both of you&#x2013;separately).<br>� Well, it&#x2019;s better than being alone. You think a bad relationship is worse than no relationship? Wrong. The danger of spending time with the wrong person is that it can cause soul ties to form: They start out as threads, become wires, and before long there&#x2019;s a cable tied around your neck, choking you. You are never alone if you have a relationship with Jesus Christ. And you have so much to work on to get yourself ready for the special-sauce mate He has for you, you don&#x2019;t have time to give in to loneliness!<br>� But I luuuv him/her! Ah, yes. Love can do many things, but it cannot conquer another person&#x2019;s weak character or usurp someone&#x2019;s will and force him or her to change. True love allows the loved one to experience the consequences of his or her decisions. As my (Chris&#x2019;s) pastor, Dr. A. R. Bernard, often says, &#x201c;Suffer the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.&#x201d;</p><h2>Language Learners in the English Classroom</h2><p>Language Learners in the English Classroom by Douglas Fisher, Carol Rothenberg, Nancy Frey [National Council of Teachers of English,2007] [Paperback]</p><p></p><h2>Understanding Basic Ecological Concepts</h2><p>This introductory text for high school students delves into the ecological topics that young people relate to: <br><br> Global warming <br> Deforestation <br> Water supplies <br> How communities and ecosystems interact, and much more. <br><br>Photographs, drawings and charts, and reviews help students come to grips with complex issues.

In a world of migration and shifting allegiances� caused by cultural, economic, military, and climatic change, the nation-state, as Judith Butler and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak argue, has become a more provisional place&#x2014;and its inhabitants, more stateless.</p><p>In a world of migration and shifting allegiances, the state&nbsp;has become&nbsp;a more provisional place and its inhabitants more stateless.&nbsp;What is contained in a state has become ever more plural while the boundaries of a state have become ever more fluid. No longer does a state naturally come with a nation. <br>This book is set in the form of a conversation between two renowned thinkers, Judith Butler and Gayatri Spivak, who discuss the fact that globalization has made things like national anthems and political boundaries obsolete. The result is a spirited and engaging conversation that ranges widely across Palestine, what Enlightenment and key contemporary philosophers have said about the state, who exercises power in today's world, whether we can have a right to rights, and even what the singing of "The Star Spangled Banner" in Spanish says about the complex world we live in today.<p><b>Judith Butler</b> is the Maxine Elliot Professor in the Departments of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley and the author of many books, including <i>Gender Trouble:</i><i>Feminism and the Subversion of Identity</i> and <i>Bodies That Matter:</i><i>On the Discursive Limits of</i> &#x2018;<i>Sex</i>.&#x2019; <b>Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak</b> is University Professor in the Humanities and&nbsp;the author of many books, including <i>The Post-Colonial Critic</i> and <i>Nationalism and Imagination</i>, the latter also published by Seagull Books. </p></p><h2>The Investigator&#39;s Little Black Book 3</h2><p>Vg condition.

Montgomery: Volume IV: 1929-1935</h2><p>Of the earlier volumes of L. M. Montgomery's journals, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Carol Shields has written: "These diaries possess the crisp, honest, unsparing voice of a real woman who fought all her life to bring her two selves together: the celebrated writer and the unloved child." Now comes the much anticipated fourth, and penultimate, volume in the series, covering the tumultuous period from 1929 to 1935. <br> By 1929 Montgomery was 54 and known world-wide as the author of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>. Yet with the stock market crash came a severe drop in her royalties and other troubling financial problems. Tremendous personal difficulties followed: Montgomery witnessed her husband's total nervous breakdown, faced concerns over her own mental state, and became the unwilling object of a young woman's passionate declaration of love. Yet this is not a period without joy, as the volume opens with exuberant travels to Prince Edward Island and western Canada and ends with her looking forward to a new life in Toronto.<br> For anyone wishing to better understand this complex and gifted author, as well as the time and place in which she lived, these journals offer a wealth of insight and information.</p><p><br><strong>Mary Rubio</strong> and <strong>Elizabeth Waterston</strong> are both members of the Department of English, University of Guelph.<br>Scholarship has caught up with what thousands of readers already know: the work of Lucy Maud Montgomery is fascinating and rich and not only for children. As scholars study Anne of Green Gables and the rest of Montgomery's prolific output, they have found that the books often overshadow the author herself. These two works highlight both Montgomery and her creations, giving readers insight into the personality that created characters who have captured the imaginations of readers for generations. The fourth volume of the Journals (Oxford published Volume 1 in 1986 and Volume 3 in 1993) provides a fascinating look at a period in Montgomery's life that was full of fatalism, fear, and moments of joy. She suffered through the Depression, witnessed her husband's nervous breakdown (and feared her own), became the unwilling object of a troubled woman's love, and suffered the deaths of numerous friends and family. Although self-conscious about the public nature of these documents (she passed her journals to her son to be published at an appropriate time), she is remarkably candid about her thoughts and feelings in these entries. Montgomery was an accomplished photographer, and the photos she placed in her journals are reproduced here, giving readers a chance to see the people, landscapes, and cats she loved. The work is also an important source of information on the social and cultural history of Canada in this period. Perhaps of more interest to nonspecialists, and timed to coincide with the 125th anniversary of Montgomery's birth, the Album combines scholarly articles, reminiscences, biography, and information on "Anne" sites in a well-designed collection full of beautifully reproduced photographs and illustrations. Readers are given insight into Montgomery's life, her society, and her writing as well as information on the films, TV programs, musicals, discussion groups, fan clubs, and festivals that her work has inspired. Both books are recommended for academic and larger public libraries.AKaren E.

It attempts to provide a new perspective through which the variety of literacy practices across different cultures can be viewed and from which the practical issues that arise in specific literacy campaigns and programmes can be approached. Dr Street first examines the explicit theories developed about literacy within different academic disciplines, on the premise that these underlie statements about literacy within development campaigns and in everyday usage. He analyses in detail arguments about the &#39;technical&#39; and &#39;neutral&#39; nature of literacy and its supposed &#39;cognitive&#39; consequences in the work of some psychologists, linguists and social anthropologists. He claims that these amount to a coherent but flawed model that he terms the &#39;autonomous&#39; model of literacy. Against this he poses an &#39;ideological&#39; model, one which pays greater attention to the social structure. He attempts to bring together recent shifts in this direction in writings on literacy and to construct a coherent model for further work.</p><p>Offers a detailed examination of theories about literacy developed by different academic disciplines and proposes an &#34;ideological&#34; model of literacy. Looks at contemporary literacy practices in the third world and Britain and, in particular, the literacy campaigns conducted by UNESCO.</p><h2>Barron&#39;s German-English Dictionary: Worterbuch Deutsch-Englisch (Barron&#39;s Bilingual Dictionaries)</h2><p><b>Barron's <i>German-English Dictionary</i> features 100,000 entries with translations, making it an ideal reference book for schools, libraries, businesses, and the home bookshelf.

Hirsch</b></p> <ol> <li><strong>What impact do you think the 2012 presidential election will have on investors?</strong></li> <p>Presidential elections every four years have a profound impact on the economy and the stock market. After a president wins the election the first two years are spent pushing through as much policy as possible. Frequently the market, economy, and country experience bear markets, recessions, and war. Since 1941, the post-election year has posted the lowest average gain for the Dow Jones Industrials at 4.5%.</p> <p>Seasonality has been on track since September 2009. 2011 unfolded in near textbook fashion. 2012 is also unfolding in rather typical seasonal and election year fashion. The catalyst for 2011's decline was persistent European debt concerns. These sovereign financial troubles continue to pressure markets. Slowing growth in emerging markets, a historically weak post-election year track record, the expiration of tax cuts, and unemployment benefits at yearend is likely to make for an exciting three-ring circus in D.C. after Election Day and plague stocks in 2013. Markets do not like uncertainty.</p> <p>Unless a full-blown bear market occurs in 2012 or the market slogs along into the New Year, market gains will be harder to come by in 2013 than they have since the March 2009 bottom. A more likely scenario is that seasonal and economic softness gives way as the presidential election approaches and some resolution in Europe coincides with at least the hint of an easing move from the Bernanke Fed.</p> <p>If things look good for Obama, October is likely to be stronger. If Romney wins, expect a bigger move in November. Either way, there have been only two losses in the last seven months of election years for the S&amp;P 500 since 1952. Also on the bright side for 2012, the DJIA has averaged 9% in years when a sitting president was running for reelection; win or lose.</p> <p>2013 is another story. Markets are likely to come under pressure as whoever the president is will have tall orders to remedy the economy, the deficit, and the dysfunctional government. The easy economic data and corporate results comparisons of the past few years will be gone. Foreign hot spots and diplomatic issues will also require renewed attention from the White House once the campaigning and/or inaugural balls are over. Central banking will remain accommodative, but there is little more they can do. After the yearend rally and positive 2012, I am concerned that the next major bear market will occur in the 2013-2014 period.</p> <li><strong>What are some of the cycles you talk about in the <i>Little Book</i> and how can investors use those?</strong></li> <p>In the <i>Little Book of Stock Market Cycles</i> I have boiled down all the most pervasive and persistent market patterns. From our nearly 50 years of research these are the ones that continue work. I begin with the long term, multi-year secular bull and bear market patterns. Then I delve deep into the nuances and details of the four-year presidential election stock market cycle, the perennial seasonal pattern before I drill down into the prevailing monthly, weekly and daily patterns. Whether you are day trading, trend trading or investing for the long haul the <i>Little Book</i> provides insight, guidance and confidence when you are making buy and sell decisions.</p> <li><strong>What's the best time of the year to trade the market?</strong></li> <p>The best time of the year to go long stocks is October and the best time to sell is April. This is our Best Six Months Switching Strategy that we discovered in 1986. The saying "sell in May and go away" has become quite well known. But I am amazed at how few fail to realize, and capitalize on, the flip side of this phenomenon. You can't sell in May if you don't buy in October. Investing in the Dow Jones Industrial Average between November 1st and April 30th each year and then switching into fixed income for the other six months has produced reliable returns with reduced risk since 1950. Our Best Months Switching Strategy will not make you an instant millionaire, as other strategies claim they can do. What it will do is steadily build wealth over time with half the risk (or less) of a "buy and hold" approach.</p> <p>Generally speaking, during the Best Months you want to be invested in equities, mutual funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs) that offer similar exposure to the companies that constitute the Dow, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 indices. During the Worst Months, switch into Treasury bonds, money market funds, or a bear/short fund. Grizzly Short (GRZZX) and AdvisorShares Active Bear (HDGE) are two possible choices. Money market funds will be the safest, but are likely to offer the smallest return, while bear/short funds offer potentially greater returns, but more risk. If the market moves sideways or higher during the Worst Months, a bear/short fund is likely to lose money. Treasuries offer a combination of decent returns with limited risk. In the 2013 Commodity Trader's Almanac, a detailed study of 30-year Treasury bonds covers their seasonal tendency to advance during summer months as well as a correlating ETF trade.</p> <p>Additional Worst Month possibilities include precious metals and the companies that mine them. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), Market Vectors Gold Miners (GDX), and ETF Securities Physical Swiss Gold (SGOL) are a few well recognized names available from the ETF universe. Gold's seasonal price tendencies are also covered in the 2013 Commodity Trader's Almanac.</p> <li><strong>Why?</strong></li> <p>The quarterly and annual operations of institutions and the seasonal behavior of society and individuals have created a Best and Worst six months of the year. Our Best Six Months Switching Strategy revolves around the fact that most of the markets gains occur from November to April while the market is usually flat to down from May to October. 2012 is a case in point.</p> <p>There is and ebb and flow of cash and trading volumes that is clearly influenced by the perennial activities of institutions individuals and society. Market seasonality is a reflection of cultural behavior. In the old days, farming was the big driver, making August the best market month-now it's one of the worst. This matches the summer vacation behavior where traders and investors prefer the golf course, beach, or poolside to the trading floor or computer screen. Institutions' efforts to beef up their numbers help drive the market higher in the fourth quarter as does holiday shopping and an influx of year-end bonus money. Then there's the New Year, which tends to bring a positive new-leaf mentality to forecasts and predictions and the anticipation of strong fourth- and first-quarter earnings. After that, trading volume tends to decline throughout the summer and then in September there's back-to-school, back-to-work, and end-of-third-quarter portfolio window dressing that has caused stocks to sell off in September, making it the worst month of the year on average.</p> <li><strong>Would you say that history repeats itself? Why or why not?</strong></li> <p>History never repeats exactly, but is sure does rhyme. The collective human memory is short and the forces of greed and fear are unrelentingly powerful. As George Santayana famously said, "Those who fail to remember the past are condemned to repeat it." I like to say, "Those who stuffy market history are bound to profit from it."</p> <p></p> </ol> <br><p>While predicting what direction the stock market will take at any given moment is difficult, if not impossible, the market does exhibit well-defined and predictable cyclical patterns. For example, history shows that the best six-month period for stocks is November through April and that by moving into stocks in October-November and out in April-May you can significantly reduce risk while increasing profits. What other important lessons does history have to teach about the market? What are the key cycles and patterns you should know about in order to optimize your investment strategies? Find out in <i>The Little Book of Stock Market Cycles</i>.</p> <p>Written by Jeffrey Hirsch, the pre-eminent authority on market cycles and seasonal patterns, this book draws upon the Hirsch Organization's five decades of meticulous historical research and market analysis to help you understand market cycles and what drives them. More importantly, it shares time-tested cycle-based trading and investing strategies that can dramatically boost your ability to capture market-beating returns, year-in and year-out, through bull markets, bear markets, and everything in between.</p> <p>If you're looking for a safe, proven alternative to conventional buy-and-hold stock strategies, this book is for you. A concise and commonsense guide, it: </p> <ul> <li>Brings together the best, time-tested indicators, patterns, and seasonalities developed and refined over the past fifty years</li> <li>Discusses longer term boom/bust economic cycles as well as shorter term tendencies involving the best hours, days, weeks, and months of the year to trade the market</li> <li>Shows how to use easy-to-implement strategies that have been proven to beat the market more than 85 percent of the time</li> <li>Describes an array of highly reliable event-driven cycles and patterns, such as presidential election cycles, the "Santa Claus Rally," and the best six-months strategy</li> <li>Explores, in-depth, the long- and short-term impacts of key exogenous factors on the market, including war, peace, inflation, political shifts, and more</li> </ul> <p>Providing simple, actionable investment strategies that have stood the test of time, <i>The Little Book of Stock Market Cycles</i> offers you a golden opportunity to learn from history and profit from its lessons.</p></p><h2>A Generative Theory of Tonal Music, reissue, with a new preface (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>A search for a grammar of music with the aid of generative linguistics.</b></p><p>This work, which has become a classic in music theory since its original publication in 1983, models music understanding from the perspective of cognitive science.The point of departure is a search for the grammar of music with the aid of generative linguistics.The theory, which is illustrated with numerous examples from Western classical music, relates the aural surface of a piece to the musical structure unconsciously inferred by the experienced listener.

But what if we thought of popular districts in more expansive ways that capture what really goes on within them? In such cities, popular districts are the settings of more uncertain operations that take place under the cover of darkness, generating uncanny alliances among disparate bodies, materials and things and expanding the urban sensorium and its capacities for liveliness.</p> <p>In this important new book AbdouMaliq Simone explores the nature of these alliances, portraying urban districts as sites of enduring transformations through rhythms that mediate between the needs of residents not to draw too much attention to themselves and their aspirations to become a small niche of exception. Here we discover an urban South that exists as dense rhythms of endurance that turn out to be vital for survival, connectivity, and becoming.</p></p><p><p><b>AbdouMaliq Simone</b> is Professor at the Max Plank Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity.</p><p>&#x201c;Here, urban worlds &#x2013; metal scrap, unhinged concrete, electrical waste, slowdowns, and interruptions &#x2013; emerge with and through secretive human connections.

Although Brunias&#x2019;s paintings have often been understood as straightforward documents of visual ethnography that functioned as field guides for reading race, this book investigates how the images both reflected <i>and </i>refracted ideas about race commonly held by eighteenth-century Britons, helping to construct racial categories while simultaneously exposing their constructedness and underscoring their contradictions. The book offers provocative new insights about Brunias&#x2019;s work gleaned from a broad survey of his paintings, many of which are reproduced here for the first time. <i></i></p><p>Mia L. Bagneris is Jesse Poesch Junior Professor of Art History at Tulane University</p><h2>Evolution of the Insects (Cambridge Evolution Series)</h2><p>This book chronicles the complete evolutionary history of insects--their living diversity and relationships as well as 400 million years of fossils. Introductory sections cover the living species diversity of insects, methods of reconstructing evolutionary relationships, basic insect structure, and the diverse modes of insect fossilization and major fossil deposits. Major sections then explore the relationships and evolution of each order of hexapods. The volume also chronicles major episodes in the evolutionary history of insects from their modest beginnings in the Devonian and the origin of wings hundreds of millions of years before pterosaurs and birds to the impact of mass extinctions and the explosive radiation of angiosperms on insects, and how they evolved into the most complex societies in nature. Whereas other volumes focus on either living species or fossils, this is the first comprehensive synthesis of all aspects of insect evolution. Illustrated with 955 photo- and electron- micrographs, drawings, diagrams, and field photos, many in full color and virtually all of them original, this reference will appeal to anyone engaged with insect diversity--professional entomologists and students, insect and fossil collectors, and naturalists. David Grimaldi and Michael S. Engel have collectively published over 200 scientific articles and monographs on the relationships and fossil record of insects, including 10 articles in the journals Science, Nature, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. David Grimaldi is curator in the Division of Invertebrate Zoology, American Museum of Natural History and adjunct professor at Cornell University, Columbia University, and the City University of New York. David Grimaldi has traveled in 40 countries on 6 continents, collecting and studying recent species of insects and conducting fossil excavations. He is the author of Amber: Window to the Past (Abrams, 2003). Michael S. Engel is an assistant professor in the Division of Entomology at the University of Kansas; assistant curator at the Natural History Museum, University of Kansas; research associate of the American Museum of Natural History; and fellow of the Linnean Society of London. Engel has visited numerous countries for entomological and paleontological studies, doing most of his fieldwork in Central Asia, Asia Minor, and the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>This book chronicles for the first time the complete evolutionary history of insects: their living diversity, relationships and 400 million years of fossils. Lavishly illustrated with original photo- and electronmicrographs, drawings, diagrams, and field photos, many in full colour. Essential reading for anyone interested in insect diversity."A landmark contribution, not just to entomology and evolutionary biology, but to the life sciences as a whole. Beautifully conceived, splendidly written, and exquisitely illustrated...Bound to remain a primary scientific reference for years to come. A must for naturalists, young and old. Truly a definitive work." <br>Thomas Eisner, Cornell University, Author of For Love of Insects<br><br>"Whatever is in store, The Evolution of Insects superbly documents the rich and colorful history of hexapods." <br>Edmund Jarzembowski, SCIENCE<br><br>"...a 'must have' for anyone interested in this extraordinary group of organisms...the stress on the importance of insects in the daily life of the planet is one of the book's many strengths...a joy simply to browse, not only because of the high standard of the images...but also because of the discoveries to be made on every page..." <br>BBC Wildlife<br><br>"...insects deserve the immense, sumptuously illustrated monography text Grimaldi and Engel have now provided. Evolution of the Insects is a hugely impressive achievement. Throughout, the writing is clear and lively, the scholarship outstanding and the amount of information summarized vast. The enthusiasm of the authors for entomology shows in every aspect of this book, but the task of creating or assembling the images alone has evidently been a colossal labor of love...for its wealth of insights, as well as its unprecedented scope and depth, this superlative synthesis should have a durable appeal not only to entomologists, but also to biologists in general." <br>TRENDS in Ecology and Evolution<br><br>"There are a number of good entomology books on the market. Few, however, have integrated the living and fossil record as seamlessly as David Grimaldi and Michael Engel's Evolution of the Insects. None, moreover, has combined this integration with so much student-friendly text and such a wealth of illustrations (more than 900)."<br>Science<br><br>"Grimaldi and Engel, two entomologists, have produced a really excellent, beautifully illustrated account that will enthrall both student and general reader. They have gone to town on the tome that is not just informative but also accessible and covers one of the most important topics in biology." <br>New Scientist<br><br>"Put all of the insects on a giant scale, and they will outweigh all other animals, whales and elephants included. And insects are also ecologically essential. If all humans decided to leave for Mars, life on Earth would not change much. All the vertebrates could probably leave as well, causing only a minimum of disruption. But if the insects disappeared, catastrophe would ensue. Forests would probably collapse, rivers and oceans would be poisoned, and many other animals would starve. Two entomologists have now written the first book that chronicles this success story. Evolution of the Insects, published by Cambridge University Press, is the result of five years' labor by David Grimaldi of the American Museum of Natural History and Michael Engel of the University of Kansas. Grimaldi and Engel are well-qualified for the job. Among their many accomplishments, they identified the oldest insect fossils from a 410-million-year-old rock in 2004. But to write Evolution of the Insects, they went well beyond their own research and synthesized the work of the armies of scientists who study living insects, dig up insect fossils and discover evolutionary secrets in insect DNA Advent of wings. This effort has produced an increasingly clear picture of the rise of insects." <br>San Diego Union Tribune<br><br>"This is a beautifully produced book, with cleanly presented photos of fossils supplemented by attractively produced photos of living taxa, elegant line drawings, diagrams, and tables. The authors and Cambridge University Press are to be congratulated for making this large volume such a pleasure to read and use." <br>J.B. Whitfield, American Entomologist<br><br>"Evolution of the Insects is filled with lavish color photographs of both fossil and recent insects." <br>George Poinar, Jr., American Scientist<br><br>"Evolution of the Insects by David Grimaldi and Michael S. Engel is the first book that has attempted to pull together and synthesize both fossil and recent evidence for insect evolution, and to present the information in an accessible, engaging way. They have succeeded to an unprecedented degree, and anyone with an active or passing interest in insects owes it to themselves to have a look." <br>Quentin D.

We&#x2019;ve asked hundreds of thousands of managers&#x2014;in our management seminars, focus groups, interviews, and surveys&#x2014;some version of this open-ended question: &#x201c;Which employee situations are most challenging for you as a manager?&#x201d; Despite the diversity of people and situations, the same basic challenges come up repeatedly. In fact, more than 90 percent of responses over the years refer to these same 27 challenges, including the superstar the manager is afraid of losing, the slacker the manager cannot figure out how to motivate, the employee with an attitude problem, and the two people who cannot get along, to name a few.</p> <p><b></b></p><b>You say that the most difficult challenges managers face come from the fact that &#x201c;employees are human... and so are their managers. &#x201d; Please Explain.</b><p></p> <p>The age-old reality is that human beings have weaknesses as well as strengths. Humans are not always great at self-management, much less at managing others. Human beings have habits&#x2014;not always good ones. Not only that, but everybody has bad days. Some people have bad weeks, months, and years. Productivity and quality of work are highly variable, sometimes due to employee performance. On top of all that, humans have attitudes&#x2014;not always good ones.</p> <br> <p><b></b></p><b>Yet you argue that managing people is harder nowadays than ever before. Why?</b><p></p> <p>That is due in large part to the incredible complexities of today&#x2019;s workplace in today&#x2019;s world, in what I like to call the &#x201c;real new economy.&#x201d; First, people come and go. That&#x2019;s always been true, but employment relationships today are far more short-term and fluid than they have been before in the modern economy. So you are always losing good people, and you are always trying to get new people on board and up to speed. Second, change is constantly coming at you from every direction. Change forces rework, often involving lots of moving parts, and therefore lots of employees in multiple departments of the organization. Third, most people must rely on many others within and without their immediate work group in order to do their own work. Finally, everybody is expected now to do more with less. Increasingly, people report that they are making do with tighter resources, longer and more complex supply lines, with shorter lead times. Often people find themselves trying to do their jobs with what they feel are insufficient resources. </p><p><b></b></p><b>How can the fundamentals be the solution to such a range of very different, sometimes rather complex, management challenges? </b><p></p><p>It turns out that when things are going wrong in a management relationship, almost always the common denominator is unstructured, low substance, hit-or-miss communication. And almost always the solution comes from applying the fundamentals of management. Throughout the book, you&#x2019;ll see&#x2014;one challenge at a time&#x2014;how the most effective managers apply the fundamentals of management to gain control of any situation with a step-by-step solution to the problem at hand. Almost always, the ad hoc manner in which most managers talk to their direct-reports every day actually makes inevitable the most difficult employee situations that tend to vex managers. What is the key to avoiding most of these problems and the key to solving them quickly and with relative ease as soon as they appear? High-structure, high-substance, one-on-one dialogues with every direct-report. </p><p><b></b></p><b>Is this book intended to be read straight through or used as a reference book that managers turn to over and over again? </b><p></p><p>Both! This book is intentionally designed to be used and reused as a reference book&#x2014;a hands-on management tool you can go back to over and over again throughout your career as a leader/manager/supervisor. Reading the whole thing beginning to end is sort of like putting one&#x2019;s self through &#x201c;management fundamentals&#x201d; boot camp, which I hope is a very worthwhile thing to do. But I also encourage readers to go ahead and skip right to the specific challenge they are facing today. And keep it on your shelf as a resource for the next time you run into a daunting challenge.

" History," "Slave," "Warning," and "Daybreak in Alabama."

Judith Lorber views gender as wholly a product of socialization subject to human agency, organization, and interpretation. In her new paradigm, gender is an institution comparable to the economy, the family, and religion in its significance and consequences. <br><br>Drawing on many schools of feminist scholarship and on research from anthropology, history, sociology, social psychology, sociolinguistics, and cultural studies, Lorber explores different paradoxes of gender:<br>&#x2015;why we speak of only two "opposite sexes" when there is such a variety of sexual behaviors and relationships; <br>&#x2015;why transvestites, transsexuals, and hermaphrodites do not affect the conceptualization of two genders and two sexes in Western societies;<br>&#x2015;why most of our cultural images of women are the way men see them and not the way women see themselves;<br>&#x2015;why all women in modern society are expected to have children and be the primary caretaker;<br>&#x2015;why domestic work is almost always the sole responsibility of wives, even when they earn more than half the family income;<br>&#x2015;why there are so few women in positions of authority, when women can be found in substantial numbers in many occupations and professions;<br>&#x2015;why women have not benefited from major social revolutions. <br><br>Lorber argues that the whole point of the gender system today is to maintain structured gender inequality&#x2015;to produce a subordinate class (women) that can be exploited as workers, sexual partners, childbearers, and emotional nurturers. Calling into question the inevitability and necessity of gender, she envisions a society structured for equality, where no gender, racial ethnic, or social class group is allowed to monopolize economic, educational, and cultural resources or the positions of power. <br></p><p>In this innovative book, a well-known feminist and sociologist challenges our most basic assumptions about gender.

Writing some twelve hundred years later, the Ming author Luo Guanzhong drew on histories, dramas, and poems portraying the crisis to fashion a sophisticated, compelling narrative that has become the Chinese national epic. This abridged edition captures the novel's intimate and unsparing view of how power is wielded, how diplomacy is conducted, and how wars are planned and fought.

Without offering pat answers, religious dogma or platitudes of any kind, the author, a Unitarian-Universalist minister who has served congregations for 18 years, provides heartfelt stories and wise words to guide the reader through the many kinds of issues that surface when a loved one has died. She speaks eloquently of the need to give authentic expression to grief and offers practical guidelines for planning a memorial service that involves the mourners and suits the unique context and person whose life is being remembered. Her chapter on the difficulty of making decisions in the face of death equips the reader to help others make hard choices when they feel most overwhelmed and vulnerable. Her discussion of &#34;family ties and family lies&#34; is refreshingly realistic, yet compassionate. York also reminds readers to acknowledge the need for rituals for the first year and beyond, rather than submitting to our culture&#39;s pressure to quickly return to life as usual. She provides a broad spectrum of resources, including poetry, suggestions for ritual and wisdom from various religious traditions. This valuable guide will prove particularly helpful for those who do not identify with any one religious tradition, yet are looking for a spiritually vital way of coping with their grief.

The grief that does not speak<br> Whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break.<br> Macbeth, Act IV, Scene 3<br> William Shakespeare <p></p> At times of death and grief, the task of planning a funeral or memorial service often falls to survivors who are unprepared to think about such an event-especially if they are alienated from formal religious traditions or from their families. Nevertheless, those who mourn need to give voice to their sorrow. The grief that does not "speak" in some way-through crying, talking, rituals, tributes, or creative expression-remains unresolved. <p></p> For centuries, religious traditions have provided society with rituals for expressing such feelings and finding peace. But for many people today, those rituals have become empty, awkward, or irrelevant. <p></p> Remembering Well offers family members, clergy, funeral professionals, and hospice workers ways to plan services and rituals that honor the spirit of the deceased and are faithful to that person's values and beliefs, while also respecting the needs and wishes of those who will attend the services.

What might be the results of evaluating too early or too much? How do we know if we are evaluating the right things? How do we know what makes sense for the learner and for the course? These questions are at the heart of Making Classroom Assessment Work. Author Anne Davies offers numerous examples and strategies to make classroom assessments effective by involving parents and the community in the assessment process and engaging students in assessing their own work and setting goals for their learning. Davies emphasizes the difference between assessment of learning and assessment for learning, and favors the latter as a process that not only assesses what has been learned, but also promotes further learning through specific and descriptive feedback, reflection, and setting and monitoring progress toward goals. Each chapter ends with a section of questions and reflections to encourage readers to guide their own learning and the learning of students, to identify key decision points in planning their own individual strategies, and to carry out assessment for learning in a way that fits their classrooms. Readers are encouraged to think about possibilities for their own application of ideas and examples discussed in each chapter.</p><p>Anne Davies, PhD, is an author, a consultant, and a researcher.

Through a series of brilliant epiphanies that parallel the development of his own aesthetic consciousness, Joyce evokes Stephen's youth, from his impressionable years as the youngest student at the Clongowed Wood school to the deep religious conflict he experiences at a day school in Dublin, and finally to his college studies where he challenges the conventions of his upbringing and his understanding of faith and intellectual freedom. James Joyce's highly autobiographical novel was first published in the United States in 1916 to immediate acclaim. Ezra Pound accurately predicted that Joyce's book would "remain a permanent part of English literature," while H.G. Wells dubbed it "by far the most important living and convincing picture that exists of an Irish Catholic upbringing." A remarkably rich study of a developing young mind, <i>A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man</i> made an indelible mark on literature and confirmed Joyce's reputation as one of the world's greatest and lasting writers.<p>Like much of James Joyce's work, <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> is a fictional re-creation of the Irish writer's own life and early environment. The experiences of the novel's young hero, Stephen Dedalus, unfold in astonishingly vivid scenes that seem freshly recalled from life and provide a powerful portrait of the coming of age of a young man of unusual intelligence, sensitivity, and character.<br>The interest of the novel is deepened by Joyce's telling portrayals of an Irish upbringing and schooling, the Catholic Church and its priesthood, Parnell and Irish politics, encounters with the conflicting roles of art and morality (problems that would follow Joyce throughout his life), sexual experimentation and its aftermath, and the decision to leave Ireland.<br>Rich in details that offer vital insights into Joyce's art, this masterpiece of semiautobiographical fiction remains essential reading in any program of study in modern literature.</p></p><h2>Infinite Jest: Caricature and Satire from Leonardo to Levine</h2><p><p>From Leonardo's drawings of grotesque heads to contemporary prints lampooning American politicians, The Metropolitan Museum of Art has a vast&nbsp;but largely unknown collection of caricatures and other satirical works. This handsome&nbsp;book offers 165 examples, dating from about 1500 to the present, that reflect the age-old tradition of using exaggeration and humor to convey personal, social, or political meaning.&nbsp;The selection of images is notably broad, ranging from the elevated to the rudely humorous:&nbsp;renowned writers and decidedly unhygienic cooks; elegantly dressed noblemen and victims of outrageous fashion fads; Napoleon as a tidy Lilliputian and Boss Tweed as a bloated Roman emperor.</p><p>Stressing the continuity of certain artistic approaches, <i>Infinite Jest</i> examines the development of the genre across&nbsp;centuries and cultures. The&nbsp;essential visual components of caricature are discussed and illustrated, as are&nbsp;recurring motifs, including exaggerated faces and bodies, people depicted as animals or objects, and processions of bizarre figures. One section is devoted to social satire (eating and drinking, gambling,&nbsp;fashion,&nbsp;several of the Seven Deadly Sins), another to various aspects of&nbsp;political life&nbsp;(British, French, Mexican,&nbsp;and American). Artists as&nbsp;diverse as Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, William Hogarth, Francisco de Goya, Thomas Rowlandson, Eug�ne Delacroix, Honor� Daumier, and Al Hirschfeld contribute their distinctive talents to this fascinating, informative, and very amusing volume.</p></p><p><b>Constance C.

Sweeping from the frigid waters of the North Atlantic to the steaming South Pacific, War Beneath the Sea is a riveting chronicle of submarine warfare. It is the first book to cover all the major submarine campaigns of the war, describing, in detail, the operations of the British, American, Japanese, Italian, and German submarine and anti-submarine forces.<p>Beginning with a vivid re-creation of the sinking of the passenger liner Athenia by a German U-boat in September 1939, Padfield's compelling narrative casts an unflinching eye on the devastating consequences of maritime warfare. The often harrowing encounters unfold with urgency and power, balanced by a master historian's keen sense of objectivity and perspective.</p><p>The submariners belonged to an elite corps, young men attracted by new technology, less formal discipline, and prospects of early promotion. For crew members, life aboard a sub was both an emotional and a physical challenge. The extraordinary hardships they endured&#x2014;as well as their courage&#x2014;come across with tremendous force.</p><p>Exploring the full spectrum of the submarine and antisubmarine warfare experience, this brilliantly detailed account pulls no punches. Facts and figures that stagger the imagination (e.g., between 1939 and 1945, 40,000 men were trained for U-boat service&#x2014;30,000 perished) are revealed in starkly human terms. Here is the shocking truth behind the failure of U.S. torpedo missions during the war's early years, along with startling accounts of the shooting of defenseless warriors in the water. Here, too, is new information about the capture of the famed Enigma cipher machine (including previously unpublished photographs), and its impact on the war effort. Until this decisive moment, Britain stood within a hairbreadth of defeat by Germany.</p><p>Disturbing questions abound: Did the inflexible attitudes of the Japanese and American military leaders prolong the war in the Pacific? Could the war have been ended before Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Padfield addresses these controversial issues with candor and insight. The result is not only an impressive achievement, but a milestone work in the history of the twentieth century.</p><p>Praise for War Beneath the Sea</p><p>"I am truly filled with awe and admiration . . . fascinating and a great contribution to the entire lore of submarines . . .

Finding Solutions and Managing Dilemmas, An Educator&#39;s Road Map</h2><p><p>With this highly accessible and unique little guide, Larry Cuban offers educators indispensable tools to make sense of the daily complexities they encounter in their work. Teachers face dozens of classroom situations where conflicts occur. Similarly, principals wrestle with school issues that call for changes in attitudes, behaviors, and procedures. Because the process is so familiar, even expert teachers and principals often have difficulty in explaining what it is that they do and how they go about solving problems and coping with dilemmas in their classrooms and schools. </p><p>Using concrete and varied examples drawn from the workplace, Cuban presents vivid and provocative case studies of practitioners&#x2019; experiences in urban and suburban schools that deal with the routine conflicts of school. He draws on his own extensive experience in public schools and his research into teaching and administration to set forth a practical framework for identifying, defining, and coping with both puzzling problems and tension-filled dilemmas. A much-needed resource for both new and experienced practitioners, <em>How Can I Fix It?</em> focuses on common skills that practitioners have&#x2015;but seldom take time to consider&#x2015;and applies these skills to concrete situations.</p></p><p><p><br> "This new book is vintage Larry Cuban.

The splendid centerpiece of A Continuous Harmony, Discipline and Hope,&#x201d; is an insightful and articulate essay of instruction and caution. This volume contains original content, with only slight revisions as might be desired. It gives readers the opportunity to read the work of this remarkable cultural critic and agrarian, and to delight in the prose of one of America&#x2019;s greatest stylists.</p><p>Wendell Berry, a Kentucky farmer and poet, may look like a Southern gentleman of conservative bearing, but in truth he stands among the foremost radical writers of our time: opposed to the dominant order, but, more important, radical in the primary sense, one who advocates a return to the source, the root, the old ways, in this case, of farming and living on the land. In <b>The Unsettling of America</b> and its companion volumes A Continuous Harmony and <b>The Gift of Good Land</b>, Berry discusses how rural communities can be made and maintained, how an ethic of wise land use can replace the dominant thinking of our present food-as-commodity economics.

The design has been refreshed, and the text by Catherine Sheldrick Ross has been lightly updated. What makes the compilation so unique and just plain interesting is how many topics it manages to cover for each of these three most basic shapes. For example, squares are explored not just in terms of what they are, how they are drawn and their geometry equations, which are all described in-depth, but also through ancient legends that feature squares, language expressions that use the word square (?back to square one?), illusions done with squares, city grids designed with squares and famous city centers that are squares (think Red Square in Moscow). There are also numerous ideas for hands-on-learning activities ---projects, puzzles, experiments --- that relate the text to everyday life.<br><br>The imaginative artwork by award-winning illustrator Bill Slavin manages to clearly convey the sometimes difficult concepts in the text, while keeping the visuals fun and humorous enough to hold the interest of young readers. It's easy to see why the books in this compilation have been perennial favorites with educators. It includes engaging, well-written, interactive content that helps make geometry and measurement concepts graspable and even enjoyable, while also offering opportunities for lessons on a range of subjects from science, technology and engineering to social studies, art, and architecture. There is an extensive table of contents, glossary, and index for reference.</p><p><p>Bill Slavin is an award-winning children's book illustrator with over 50 books to his credit. His works include Stanley's Party and The Bear on the Bed He lives in Millbrook, Ontario.</p>This bountiful compendium brings together three colorful books originally published separately in paperback: Circles (1993), Triangles (1994), and Squares (1996). Each section leads off with a close-up look at its subject using a geometric figure with arrows pointing to nearby terms and definitions. The section on squares includes square numbers, square-based optical illusions, cubes in architecture, and instructions for making a tangram. The next section includes a wide assortment of triangle-related topics, from the Egyptian pyramids to the Bermuda Triangle, from bridge construction to fractals. Similarly, the third section explores circles and spheres as well as concepts such as pi and Fibonacci numbers. Ink drawings with watercolor washes brighten each page and clarify the concepts and explanations in the text. Precise yet playful in approach, this book supplies a good deal of basic information while entertaining readers with short narratives, challenges, and hands-on activities. An engaging introduction to basic geometry.

Based on her scientific approach to child learning through observation and experimentation, the Montessori Method champions a classroom where children are encouraged to interact with their environment and develop their own natural need for knowledge.</p><p>In <i>Basic Montessori</i>, David Gettman has devised a clear and modern explanation of Montessori's revolutionary ideas about early intellectual development, offering a step-by-step guide to the learning behaviors most commonly used with children under-five. These include activities for introducing reading and writing, counting and decimal concepts, science, and geography, as well as activities that help develop the child's practical and sensorial skills.</p><p>A perfect primer for teachers, child caregivers, and parents, this volume shares this essential program to help adults discover how their children learn.</p></p><p><p><b>David Gettman</b> studied at the University of California at Santa Cruz, and after attending the Maria Montessori Training Organization's course in London, opened a small Montessori nursery school near San Francisco.</p>Maria Montessori (1870-1952) was a brilliant and original educator. Her work with children stressed the importance of autonomy as an educational goal. Renewed interest in her philosophy and teaching methods and the clear format of this book make it a good choice for public libraries. There is detailed information on her philosophy and an in-depth explanation of her teaching methods. Coverage of practical, sensorial, cultural, mathematic, and language activities includes a statement of the activity's purpose, materials needed (and suggestions on how to make them at home), and exercises. A good reference tool for everyone wanting to know more about or intending to try the Montessori method whether they are parents, teachers, or day-care personnel. Annette V.

At least it is until he realizes he forgot this week&#39;s assignment, &#34;Bring in something fun to measure.&#34; Tyler, the class show-off, brings a picture of himself from the newspaper. How can Zack top that when all he has to work with is a piece of paper he finds in his pocket? Week after week Zack takes on a different math concept (length, width, area, perimeter) with surprising projects including a mobius strip, a paper frame large enough to step through, and a light show that demonstrates how the sun heats the earth.</p><p>Joanne Anderson Reisberg is a former teacher. She lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Grade 2-4&#x2013;A well-explained introduction to the concepts of area, perimeter, length, and width. Each Friday, Ms. Merkle has her students share objects as part of a mathematical show-and-tell. Zachary has a tendency to forget and must use his ingenuity to meet the assignment's requirements. One week, he uses a piece of paper to create a Moebius Strip, which serves as something to measure. The following Friday, he uses a scrap of paper to make an expanding frame for his lesson on perimeters. For his third assignment, he uses a flashlight to show the area of a rectangle. The text has realistic dialogue, and Zachary's ability to explain his projects to his classmates ensures that readers also have a very good chance of understanding the lessons. The plot also includes a rivalry between Zachary and another boy to give the most interesting presentation each week. This rivalry is well developed, and readers will recognize the classroom dynamics in action as the story builds. The resolution is believable and positive. Hohn's illustrations bring the story to life with plenty of detail. Sharp-eyed readers will notice that the blackboard lists the Friday assignments, further reinforcing the terms and concepts. At the end of the book, each of Zachary's three transformations is explained in well-detailed steps so children can try them on their own. Youngsters will find Zachary's quick thinking and solid explanations both entertaining and educational.<i>&#x2013;Maura Bresnahan, High Plain Elementary School, Andover, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for her novel, &#34;The Element of Water,&#34; Her first novel, &#34;Boy Blue,&#34; won the Fawcett Society Book Prize in 1987, and her work has also been shortlisted for the Orange Prize for Fiction.Elizabeth Barrett Browning's life reads like a novel, more dramatic and compelling than the poet's own work suggests. This biographical study, on the other hand, tries to cram itself and the poet within the narrow boundaries of the Welsh-English border region where Barrett Browning spent her youthful years at Hope End, the "Indian Gothic" mansion her father designed and built in 1809. Arranging the scholarly book thematically rather than strictly chronologically, Dennis, a professor of Victorian studies in Wales, takes pains to give credit for the works from Barrett Browning's London and Italian fame to those formative "Hope End Years." Born in 1806, she was intellectually and artistically precocious, publishing famed poems in her teens. The remoteness of Hope End and her father's authoritarianism, however, helped keep her socially isolated. The first man with whom she developed a friendship outside her family circle was her married, blind tutor, Hugh Boyd. Letters and poems present her regard for him with all the expected propriety, while her diary at age 25 reveals a mad schoolgirl crush. "Where the letters are balanced, dispassionate, witty, the diary... rages with anguished questioning and the torments of jealousy and suspected slights." Mentions of the dependence of the poet on laudanum and of her family's finances on slavery are incomplete, but the author well details Barrett Browning's relationships with Boyd, Mary Mitford, her father, her favorite brother and husband Robert Browning.

Of all the goals that people strive for, which ones really matter? This volume makes a powerful case for the inclusion of ultimate concerns-- spiritual and religious themes in personal strivings-- in any attempt to build a motivational theory of personality. The book first reviews the growing body of empirical and clinical literature on goal seeking and its relationship to subjective well-being, life satisfaction, and personality description. Emmons then sets forth an innovative framework for the assessment and measurement of ultimate concerns. Topics covered include implications of spiritual strivings for mental health and treatment, conflicts between different kinds of goals, ways that ultimate concerns can foster personality integration, goal processes in stress and coping, and the concept of spiritual intelligence. Sample assessment materials are shown in the Appendix, illuminating the author's research methodology. <br></p><p>Robert A.

It is also a book that participates in the re-reading of Irish history that was part of the revival of the early 20th century. The author also wrote &#34;Ulysses&#34;, &#34;Dubliners&#34; and &#34;Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man&#34;.</p><p>James Joyce was born in Dublin on 2 February 1882, the eldest of ten children in a family which, after brief prosperity, collapsed into poverty. He was none the less educated at the best Jesuit schools and then at University College, Dublin, and displayed considerable academic and literary ability. Although he spent most of his adult life outside Ireland, Joyce&#39;s psychological and fictional universe is firmly rooted in his native Dublin, the city which provides the settings and much of the subject matter for all his fiction. He is best known for his landmark novel Ulysses (1922) and its controversial successor Finnegans Wake (1939), as well as the short story collection Dubliners (1914) and the semi-autobiographical novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916). James Joyce died in Z�rich, on 13 January 1941.&#39;Listening to Jim Norton and Marcella Riordan is a lot easier than trying to read the book.&#39; (The Guardian) &#39;It&#39;s estimated that a complete recording of this eccentric masterpiece would run to about 20 CDs, but Naxos has made an attractive abridgement in four, recorded with wit and clarity by Jim Norton and Marcella Riordan. I&#39;ve never met anyone who has actually managed to read every page of this extraordinary book...and there can be little doubt that Joyce intended his work to be listened to as much as read. This brilliant recording is the perfect short cut for slackers, poseurs and insomniacs.&#39; (Robert McCrum, The Observer)</p><h2>Down by the River</h2><p>Set in the author&#39;s native Ireland, a powerful and passionate novel relates the story of a young girl who becomes pregnant by her father, a situation made worse when it becomes fodder for the mill of church, state, and the town square. Tour.</p><p>A few years ago, Ireland was forced to confront its conscience when a 14-year-old girl, the purported victim of rape, sought an abortion in England. The ensuing legal and moral battles exposed the Emerald Isle's centuries-long struggles over religion, sexuality, and the position of women. Irish writer Edna O'Brien revisits this embattled territory in her novel <i>Down by the River</i>, a bleak, uncompromising chronicle of poverty, unwanted pregnancy, and despair. O'Brien's protagonist is Mary, almost 14 years old and pregnant by her widowed father. In a repressed, judgmental rural world, Mary can tell no one of her plight. Eventually she tries to drown herself, only to be rescued by a neighbor, Betty. When Betty learns the reason for Mary's suicide attempt, she arranges to take her to England for an abortion. Before the operation can occur, Mary is coerced into returning to Ireland and there she becomes the focal point in a ferocious nationwide debate about abortion. <p> O'Brien is unsparing in her depictions of the economic and emotional poverty in which her characters live, yet she can be surprisingly empathetic toward even the least likeable among them, showing, for example, the tender side of Mary's father even as she exposes his brutality. The book's language is rich and laden with imagery, at times in shocking contrast to the parched lives she describes. <i>Down by the River</i> is just the latest in a long line of fiercely honest books by a fearlessly honest author.</p>Edna O'Brien is the author of 19 books. She was the winner of the 1993 Writers Guild Prize for Fiction. Her biography of James Joyce was published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in June 1999. Her recent fiction has been about Irish topics - religion, politics, property. In 2001 her documentary novel, In the Forest - about a brutal murder on the west coast - caused a furore in her native Ireland. It was the subject of a BBC Omnibus film.</p><h2>Puppetry: How to Do It</h2><p>Written by an experienced theatre and puppetry director, Mervyn Millar's&nbsp;<em>Puppetry: How to Do It</em>&nbsp;focuses on the performer and the craft of bringing any puppet to life.

Most often, that crafting of light is spoken of in terms of the <i>quality</i> and <i>quantity</i> of light. But there is an important, third component of light that heavily influences the final look of the image: the <i>color</i> of light. In <i>Chroma: A Photographer&#x2019;s Guide to Lighting with Color</i>, photographer Nick Fancher helps you elevate your game when it comes to introducing the bold, creative, and intentional use of color into your work.<p></p> <p>Whether you&#x2019;re using a high-powered strobe or a small hotshoe flash, <i>Chroma</i> is for you. Nick begins with a discussion of color theory, gels, and white balance, then examines how to determine which colors complement your subject matter (whether that&#x2019;s people or products). He moves on to cover topics such as:</p> <ul> <li> Balancing, mixing, and overpowering ambient light with artificial light</li> <li>Layering colors for unique color combinations</li> <li>Mixing hard and soft light to achieve extremely rich color</li> <li>Lighting detail and texture</li> <li>Modifier options, such as ring flash, snoots, barn doors, softboxes, and filters</li> <li>Gobos to control the light</li> <li>Post-processing for vibrant, powerful colors</li> <li>How (and why) to light with color, even when the end goal is a black and white image</li> </ul> <p>Illustrated throughout with innovative and expressive imagery, <i>Chroma</i> also includes behind-the-scenes photos, lighting diagrams, and Lightroom settings so you can follow along from the initial concept through to the final edit.</p></p><p>Nick Fancher is a photographer, author, and educator, who specializes in the use of minimal gear in unconventional locations. Though his work ranges wide from commercial and product photography to fine art portraiture and photojournalism, his passion lies in dramatic light and bold color use. He graduated from Ohio State University with a bachelor's in fine art photography in 2005.&nbsp;He currently lives in Columbus, Ohio with his wife and two kids.&nbsp;He can be found online at nickfancher.com or Instagram (@nickfancher).</p><h2>Natural Perspective: The Development of Shakespearean Comedy and Romance</h2><p><p>Frye maintains that Shakespeare's comedy is widely misunderstood and underestimated, and that the four romances-- <i>Pericles, Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale,</i> and <i>The Tempest</i>--are the inevitable culmination of the poet's career.</p></p><p>In A Natural Perspective, distinguished critic Northrop Frye maintains that Shakespeare&#39;s comedy is widely misunderstood and underestimated, and that the four romances - Pericles, Cymbeline, The Winter&#39;s Tale, and The Tempest - are the inevitable culmination of the poet&#39;s career. Rather than comment only on individual plays, Frye treats the comedies as a group unified by recurrent structures, devices, and images: the storm at sea, the identical twins, the heroine disguised as a boy, the retreat into the forest, the heroine with a mysterious father.</p><h2>Stoicism (Ancient Philosophies)</h2><p>Stoicism was one of the most influential schools of philosophy in antiquity and its influence has persisted to the present day. Originating in Athens around 300 BCE, Stoicism flourished for some five hundred years and has remained a constant presence throughout the history of Western philosophy. As one of the most popular philosophies of the Roman world, its doctrines appealed to people from all strata of ancient society - from the slave Epictetus to the emperor Marcus Aurelius. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to this great philosophical school. As well as outlining the central philosophical ideas of Stoicism, it aims to introduce readers to the different ancient authors and sources that they will encounter when exploring Stoicism. This book begins by introducing the ancient Stoics and their works. It then considers how the Stoics themselves conceived philosophy and how they formulated their own philosophical system. The core chapters examine Stoic philosophical doctrines in depth, taking each division of Stoic theory in turn: logic, physics, and ethics. The final chapter provides a fascinating account of the Stoic legacy from later antiquity to the present. This book includes a glossary, chronology and guide to further reading, which, together with its accessible yet authoritative approach, make it an ideal introduction for students and general readers.</p><p>"Stoicism needs a new work of this kind. Sellars not only takes good account of the last thirty years of research, he also has much of his own to contribute. I particularly applaud his focus on Epictetus and on Stoicism as an art of life.&nbsp;"&#x2014;A.A. Long, author of <i>Stoic Studies</i>John Sellars is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of the West of England, Bristol.</p><h2>Witness for the Defense: The Accused, the Eyewitnesses, and the Expert Who Puts Memory on Trial</h2><p>Explains why eyewitness identifications, usually damning, can be unreliable and can result in the conviction of innocent people</p><p>Loftus, a psychologist and an expert on memory, has testified on the fallibility of eyewitness identification in over 150 trials during the last 16 years. Here she recounts her experiences as an expert witness for various defendants, including Steve Titus, whose rape conviction was overturned with her help. She also presents her review of the John "Ivan the Terrible" Demjanjuk case. In discussing her research on memory, Loftus reveals how some information is lost from memory or never stored and how memories can be altered by subsequent events. She shows how problems with police procedures in line-ups, photo identifications, and interviews as well as other factors can affect memory and lead to misidentification. Actual exchanges on the witness stand plus her analysis of evidentiary material make for engrossing and troubling reading. Highly recommended for the general public and scholars interested in whether justice is served in the criminal justice system.<br><i>- Mary Jane Brustman, SUNY at Albany Libs.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Human memory may not, as many think, resemble a nonerasable tape of our lives' events, replayable at a whim. That, at any rate, is the view of University of Washington psychologist Loftus ( Eyewitness Testimony ), writing here with Ketcham ( Under the Influence ). Her theory is that three major stages exist in the memory--acquisiton, retention and retrieval--and that problems can develop at any stage, rendering memory highly fallible. Loftus has testified as an expert witness in more than 150 court cases, several of which she details here. She urges juries to remain skeptical of eyewitness's identifications of defendants, and she demonstrates how mistakes have been made. This is a book of surpassing interest and potential influence for psychology students, prosecutors and the general public. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Discourse and the Construction of Society: Comparative Studies of Myth, Ritual, and Classification</h2><p>In this bold theoretical work, Bruce Lincoln explores the ways in which myth, ritual, and classification hold human societies together--and how, in times of crisis, they can be used to take a society apart and reconstruct it. Without overlooking the role of coercive force in the maintenance (or overthrow) of social structures, Lincoln argues his thesis with compelling illustrations drawn from such diverse areas as Platonic philosophy, the Upanishads of India, ancient Celtic banquets, professional wrestling, and the Spanish Civil War. This wide-ranging interdisciplinary study--which draws on works in history, semiotics, anthropology, sociology, classics, and indology--offers challenging new insights into the complex dynamics of social cohesion and change.</p><p><br><strong>Bruce Lincoln</strong> is Caroline E. Haskell Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions in the Divinity School, the University of Chicago. He has published four other books, including <em>Priests, Warriors, and Cattle: A Study in the Ecology of Religions</em>, which won the American Council of Learned Societies Prize as Best New Book in History of Religions in 1981.<br>"I read Bruce Lincoln's Discourse and the Construction of Society with pleasure and profit; he has the art of stating complicated ideas plainly without simplifying them, and the gift for finding telling examples; together these two qualities make his book engaging--and also useful. It is a<br>kind of kit for thinking about society."--James Redfield, University of Chicago<br><br>"Offers a perspective on how different processes of orally delivered discourse can be used for the creation, maintenance, or disintegration of society. It raises our consciousness of the power of discourse, not only as narrative that informs but also as polemic that can create and<br>destroy."--Oral History<br><br>"Lincoln's works always bring a breath of fresh air, and this one no exception....His use and treatment of a multiplicity of fields make his work relevant to many disciplines, including the history of religions, anthropology, sociology, political science, and semiotics. Highly<br>recommended."--Religious Studies Review<br><br>"Discourse and the Construction of Society is a helpful monkey wrench for canonbusters, cultural and political activists, and other demystifiers of dominant discourse. In this cross-disciplinary study...Lincoln...examines the role of symbolic discourse and its ugly cousin, force, in<br>constructing society."--Voice Literary Supplement<br><br>"The book's heterogeneity is vivid and its author adroit--his sense of loose links among rituals of resistance from highbrow politics and lowbrow media events alike should make good classroom fare."--American Anthropologist<br><br>"Lincoln's splendidly eclectic cultural critique unveils both the conceptual rigidity and the flexible uses of classification in social and political life....An exemplary achievement, arrayed in arrestingly lucid prose."--Michael Herzfeld, Choice<br><br>"Deserves to be widely read by people interested in social history."--Journal of Social History<br><br>"A masterful and imaginitive argument for the centrality of symbolic action in modern societies."--P. Manning, Michigan State University</p><h2>Public Anthropology: Engaging Social Issues in the Modern World</h2><p><p>Contemporary anthropology has changed drastically in the new millennium, expanding beyond the anachronistic study of "primitive" societies to confront the burning social, economic, and political challenges of the day. In the process, anthropologists often come face to face with issues that require them to take a public position&#x2014;issues such as race and tolerance, health and well-being, food security, reconciliation and public justice, global terror and militarism, and digital media</p><br><br><p>This comprehensive but accessible book is both an interesting read and an excellent overview of public anthropology. In-depth case studies offer an opportunity to evaluate the pros and cons of engaging with public issues, while profiles of select anthropologists ensure the book is contemporary, but rooted in the history of the discipline.</p></p><p><b>Edward J. Hedican</b> is a professor emeritus at the University of Guelph.<br>Hedican has produced an engaging book that offers a solid introduction to public anthropology.
